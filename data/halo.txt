Remember those walls I built Well baby theyre tumbling down And they didnt even put up a fight They didnt even make a sound  I found a way to let you in But I never really had a doubt Standing in the light of your halo I got my angel now  Its like Ive been awakened Every rule I had you breaking Its the risk that Im taking I aint never gonna shut you out  Everywhere Im looking now Im surrounded by your embrace Baby I can see your halo You know youre my saving grace  Youre everything I need and more Its written all over your face Baby I can feel your halo Pray it wont fade away  I can feel your halo halo halo I can see your halo halo halo I can feel your halo halo halo I can see your halo halo halo  Hit me like a ray of sun Burning through my darkest night Youre the only one that I want Think Im addicted to your light  I swore Id never fall again But this dont even feel like falling Gravity cant forget To pull me back to the ground again  Feels like Ive been awakened Every rule I had you breaking The risk that Im taking Im never gonna shut you out  Everywhere Im looking now Im surrounded by your embrace Baby I can see your halo You know youre my saving grace  Youre everything I need and more Its written all over your face Baby I can feel your halo Pray it wont fade away  I can feel your halo halo halo I can see your halo halo halo I can feel your halo halo halo I can see your halo halo halo I can feel your halo halo halo I can see your halo halo halo  I can feel your halo halo halo I can see your halo halo halo Halo halo Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Everywhere Im looking now Im surrounded by your embrace Baby I can see your halo You know youre my saving grace  Youre everything I need and more Its written all over your face Baby I can feel your halo Pray it wont fade away  I can feel your halo halo halo I can see your halo halo halo I can feel your halo halo halo I can see your halo halo halo  I can feel your halo halo halo I can see your halo halo halo I can feel your halo halo halo I can see your halo halo halo
