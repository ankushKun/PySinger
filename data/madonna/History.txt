(Repeat history, just repeat history,...) 
 I looked all around the world 
 Nobody has it better than we do 
 Uh huh 
 One thing I don't understand 
 Why don't we help more people 'cause we can 
 Uh huh 
 (All around the world, all around the world,...) 
 Why are we separated 
 Defined by our greed and hatred 
 Why aren't we all united 
 I'm so sick and tired of fighting 
 Why aren't we all together 
 Let's end this fight forever 
 Why are we still divided 
 I'm so sick and tired of fighting 
 How many tragedies will we see before we come together 
 Uh huh 
 It's easy to forget we have a power to make things better 
 Uh huh 
 I have a dream 
 But dreams are not for free 
 We all need to change 
 Or just repeat history (just repeat history, just repeat history,...) 
 (All around the world, all around the world,...) 
 Why are we separated 
 Defined by our greed and hatred 
 Why aren't we all united 
 I'm so sick and tired of fighting 
 Why aren't we all together 
 Let's end this fight forever 
 Why are we still divided 
 I'm so sick and tired of fighting 
 (Just repeat history, just repeat history,...)
