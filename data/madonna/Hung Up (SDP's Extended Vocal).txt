So slowly 
 So slowly 
 So slowly 
 So slowly... 
 Time goes by so slowly 
 Time goes by so slowly 
 Time goes by so slowly 
 Time goes by so slowly... 
 I'm hung up on you 
 I'm hung up on you 
 Every little thing that you say or do 
 I'm hung up 
 I'm hung up on you 
 Waiting for your call baby night and day 
 I'm fed up 
 I'm tired of waiting on you 
 Time goes by so slowly for those who wait 
 No time to hesitate 
 Those who run seem to have all the fun 
 I'm caught up, I don't know what to do 
 Time goes by so slowly 
 Time goes by so slowly 
 Time goes by so slowly 
 I don't know what to do 
 Every little thing that you say or do 
 I'm hung up 
 I'm hung up on you 
 Waiting for your call baby night and day 
 I'm fed up 
 I'm tired of waiting on you 
 Every little thing 
 Every little thing 
 Hung Up 
 I'm hung up on you 
 Waiting for your call 
 Waiting for your call 
 Fed Up 
 I'm tired of waiting on you 
 Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone 
 The lights are on but there's no one home 
 Tick tick tock it's a quarter to two 
 And I'm done, I'm hangin' up on you 
 Time goes by so slowly 
 Time goes by so slowly 
 Time goes by so slowly 
 Time goes by so slowly... 
 So slowly 
 So slowly 
 So slowly 
 So slowly... 
 I don't know what to do 
 Every little thing that you say or do 
 I'm hung up 
 I'm hung up on you 
 Waiting for your call baby night and day 
 I'm fed up 
 I'm tired of waiting on you 
 Every little thing that you say or do 
 I'm hung up 
 I'm hung up on you 
 Waiting for your call baby night and day 
 I'm fed up 
 I'm tired of waiting on you 
 Every little thing 
 Every little thing 
 Hung Up 
 I'm hung up on you 
 Waiting for your call 
 Waiting for your call 
 Fed Up 
 I'm tired of waiting on you 
 Please hang up and try again
