Dance, You're not fighting 
 Dance, You're not lying 
 Dance, You're not cheating 
 Dance, You're only triggering your senses 
 You're not dying 
 Dance, You're not crying 
 Dance, You're not killing yourself 
 You're only triggering your senses 
 You're only triggering your senses 
 Dance is a lovely friend 
 Dance to your heart's content 
 Dance and we don't pretend 
 Dance is your only friend 
 When you're on the street 
 To a different beat 
 When you're feeling down 
 When there's no one else around 
 Dance, You're not taking 
 Dance, You're not hating 
 Dance, You're not kiling yourself 
 You're only triggering your senses 
 You're only triggering your senses 
 A hip, a hip, a hippety hop and you don't stop, you get on your feet 
 You do the hip hop to a different beat 
 I know you don't stop when you're on the street 
 You're not feeling down and there's no one else around 
 You get on your feet until you hear the funky beat 
 When you're on the street 
 To a different beat 
 When you're feeling down 
 When there's no one else around 
 When there's no one else around 
 Dance, You're not fighting 
 Dance, You're not lying 
 Dance, You're not cheating 
 Dance, You're only triggering your senses 
 You're not dying 
 Dance, You're not crying 
 You're not killing yourself 
 You're only triggering your senses 
 You're only triggering your senses 
 Triggering your senses 
 Triggering your 
 Dance
