Do I have to change my name? 
 Am I gonna be a star? 
 Do I have to change my name? 
 Am I gonna be a star? 
 spoken: 
 I'm drinkin' a soy latte 
 I get a double shot; 
 It goes right through my body 
 And you know I'm satisfied 
 I drive my Mini Cooper 
 And I'm feeling super-duper 
 Yo they tell me I'm a trooper 
 And you know I'm satisfied 
 I do yoga and pilates 
 And the room is full of hotties 
 So I'm checking out their bodies 
 And you know I'm satisfied 
 I'm diggin' on the isotope 
 This metaphysics shit is dope 
 And if all this can give me hope 
 You know I'm satisfied 
 I got a lawyer and a manager 
 An agent and a chef 
 Three nannies, an assistant 
 And a driver and a jet 
 A trainer and a butler 
 And a bodyguard or five 
 A gardener and a stylist 
 Do you think I'm satisfied? 
 I'd like to express my extreme point-of-view 
 I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew 
 I'm just living out the American dream 
 And I just realized that nothing is what it seems 
 Chorus (twice): 
 American life [American life] 
 I live the American dream [American dream] 
 You are the best thing I've seen 
 You are not just a dream [American life] 
 (Repeat "Spoken") 
 Repeat Chorus (twice) 
 Do I have to change my name? 
 Am I gonna be a star? 
 Do I have to change my name? 
 Am I gonna be a star? 
 Do I have to change my name? [American life] 
 Am I gonna be a star? [I'm the American dream] 
 Do I have to change my name? [American life] 
 Am I gonna be a star?
