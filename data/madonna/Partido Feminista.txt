Crowd: 
 (Evita Peron, Partido Feminista) [repeat in background] 
 Madonna: 
 Peron is everything, he is the soul, the nerve 
 The hope and the reality of the Argentine people 
 We all know that there is only one man in our movement 
 With his own source of light 
 We all feed from his light, and that is Peron 
 Antonio Banderas: 
 And now she wants to be vice-president 
 Chorus boys: 
 That was the over-the-top, unacceptable suggestion 
 We didn't approve but we couldn't prevent 
 The games of the wife of the president 
 But to give her pretensions encouragement 
 She's out of her depth, and out of the question.
