I went down to the local bar 
 To buy my daddy a big cigar 
 When I got home he was dead 
 Somebody shot him in the head 
 Oh dear daddy 
 You're not gonna see me grieve 
 'Cause you brought out the worst in me 
 spoken: 
 Yep! It's all true 
 It's true. It makes me cry 
 When the funeral was through 
 I had myself a barbecue 
 Daddy's bones they sure taste good 
 I couldn't have stopped; if only I could 
 (Or: I'd have killed him myself; if only I could) 
 Oh dear daddy 
 You're not gonna see me sad 
 'Cause everything you did was bad
