You are who you are (are are) 
 I'm so in love with you 
 What can I do 
 That's where you take me 
 You take me 
 Take me 
 Take me 
 Love me 
 What can I do 
 What can I do 
 A box of chocolates 
 A football team 
 Flowers growing in the garden 
 Flowers growing in the garden 
 You are who you are (are are) 
 I'm so in love with you 
 What can I do 
 What can I do 
 What can I do 
 What can I do 
 I'm so in love with you 
 What can I do 
 What can I do 
 What can I do 
 I'm so in love with you 
 That's where you take me 
 You take me 
 Take me 
 That's where you take me 
 You take me 
 Take me 
 There is a light 
 Above my head 
 Into your eyes 
 You are who you are (are are) 
 I'm so in love with you 
 What can I do 
 What can I do 
 What can I do 
 What can I do 
 I'm so in love with you 
 What can I do 
 What can I do 
 What can I do 
 I'm so in love with you 
 There a light 
 There a light 
 A light 
 There 
 There
