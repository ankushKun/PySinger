 Here comes the sun (here comes the sun) 
 I'm tired of coming undone (oh, coming undone) 
 There's been so much darkness, too much of the time 
 I think it's a sign (must be a sign) 
 Here comes the rain (here comes the rain) 
 Wash away all the pain (wash away the pain) 
 Coming together, going apart, I want you to stay 
 (Hope you wanna stay) 
 Always a bride's maid, never the bride 
 Two steps behind, you've got too much pride 
 Always supporting, never the star (ever the star) 
 Get it together, 'cause the beat goes on 
 On and on and on the beat goes, on and on and on the beat goes 
 On and on and on the beat goes, on and on and on the beat goes 
 On and on and on the beat goes, on and on and on the beat goes 
 On and on and on the beat goes, on and on and on the beat goes 
 Here comes my hand (here comes your hand) 
 Take it while you can (take it while you can) 
 I'll throw you some rope, if it will give you hope 
 Want you to understand (understand) 
 Here comes your smile (here comes your smile) 
 Hope it stays for a while (stays for a while) 
 You know it's contagious, it might sound outrageous 
 But, I feel so alive (feel so alive) 
 Always a bride's maid, never the bride (never the bride) 
 Two steps behind, you've got too much pride (so much pride) 
 Always supporting, never the star (ever the star) 
 Get it together, 'cause the beat goes on 
 On and on and on the beat goes, on and on and on the beat goes 
 On and on and on the beat goes, on and on and on the beat goes 
 On and on and on the beat goes, on and on and on the beat goes 
 On and on and on the beat goes, on and on and on the beat goes 
 I can't keep waiting for you (what?) (come on) 
 I can't keep waiting (take it down) 
 Anticipating with you (what?) 
 You keep me waiting (take it up) 
 I can't keep waiting for you (what?) 
 I can't keep waiting (take it down) 
 Anticipating with you 'cause, see, the beat goes on 
 Always a bride's maid, never the bride (never the bride) 
 Two steps behind, you've got too much pride (there's too much pride) 
 Always supporting, never the star (ever the star) 
 Get it together, 'cause the beat goes on 
 On and on and on the beat goes, on and on and on the beat goes 
 (Come on) 
 On and on and on the beat goes, on and on and on the beat goes 
 (Can't keep waiting for you) 
 On and on and on the beat goes, on and on and on the beat goes 
 (Take it down) 
 On and on and on the beat goes, on and on and on the beat instrumentation 
 I can't keep waiting for you 
 I can't keep waiting (take it down) 
 Anticipating with yo 
 You keep me waiting (can't keep waiting for you) 
 I can't keep waiting for you 
 I can't keep waiting (take it down) 
 Anticipating with you 'cause, see, the beat goes on
