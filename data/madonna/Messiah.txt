I am the promise that you cannot keep 
 Reap what you sow, find what you seek 
 I am the sorceress down in the deep 
 I am the earth under your feet 
 I am the moon with no light of my own 
 You are the sun guarding your throne 
 I heard the angels whisper to me 
 Look for the signs, he is the one 
 I'll light a candle here in the dark 
 Making my way to your heart 
 I'll cast a spell that you can't undo 
 'Til you wake up and you find that you love me too 
 'Til you wake up and you find that you love me too 
 I'll be the bride that is married to life 
 You are the day, I am the night 
 Weave you a blanket of silver and gold 
 I'll keep you warm, do as I'm told 
 I need your strength, it will keep me from harm 
 I'll be your Queen, safe in your arms 
 Don't want to get to the end of my days 
 Saying I wasn't amazed 
 I'll light a candle here in the dark 
 Making my way to your heart 
 I'll cast a spell that you can't undo 
 'Til you wake up and you find 
 I'll light a candle here in the dark 
 Making my way to your heart 
 I'll cast a spell that you can't undo 
 'Til you wake up and you find that you love me too 
 'Til you wake up and you find that you love me too 
 'Til you wake up and you find that you love me too
