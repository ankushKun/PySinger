You want, I've got 
 You take, have not 
 Your loss, my gain 
 We're all the same 
 You're in the game but you don't know it 
 Get in control or you're gonna blow it 
 Ask him his name, find out where did he come from 
 I wanna know if he's really God's son 
 Is he really God's son? 
 You have, I lack 
 We fade to black 
 Your move, I take 
 You win, checkmate 
 We're all sick, but we just can't see it 
 Call it a trick, but we don't wanna be it 
 Try to break through all of your defenses 
 How would it feel to let go of your senses? 
 Don't forget to ask him his name 
 If you knew what I knew you'd be doing the same 
 Ambiguity does us no good 
 I want everything to be understood 
 You want, I've got, you take, have not 
 Your loss, my gain, we're all the same 
 You have, I lack, we fade to black 
 Your move, I take, you win, checkmate 
 We're in a game but we don't know it 
 Get in control or we're all gonna blow it 
 Ask him his name, find out where did he come from 
 I wanna know if he's really God's son 
 Don't forget to ask him his name 
 If you knew what I knew you'd be doing the same 
 Ambiguity does us no good 
 I want everything to be understood
