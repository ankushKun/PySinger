Speak 
 Don't say forgive me 
 Don't say you're sorry 
 I can't take it anymore 
 Can't take it, can't take it 
 Can't take it, can't take it anymore 
 Listen to your lies and all you stories 
 And I, and I can't take it anymore 
 Can't take it, can't take it 
 Can't take it, can't take it anymore 
 Don't say forgive me 
 I've heard it all before 
 Don't say you're sorry 
 I've seen it all before 
 And I've heard it all before 
 Don't talk, don't speak 
 Don't talk, don't speak (sorry, sorry) 
 Don't talk, don't speak (sorry, sorry) 
 Don't 
 Don't talk, don't speak (sorry, sorry) 
 Don't talk, don't speak (sorry, sorry) 
 Don't talk, don't speak (sorry, sorry) 
 Don't talk, don't speak (sorry, sorry)
