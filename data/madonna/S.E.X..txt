Oh my God, you're so hot 
 Hold my hand, let me get on top 
 Oh my God, soaking wet 
 Back and forth 'til we break the bed 
 When you read my mind, get down and discover me 
 I'm an open door, let you come inside of me 
 Wanna put my hands around your neck 
 Gonna take you to a place that you will not forget 
 Sex, what do you know about sex 
 Tell me what you know about sex 
 Sex, what do you know about sex 
 Oh my God, you're so hot 
 Hold my hand, let me get on top 
 Oh my God, soaking wet 
 Back and forth 'til we break the bed 
 You got a bad attitude 
 I like to grant it on you 
 And when I let you put it on me 
 You better give me what I want baby 
 Oh my God, let me clean your room, I can be your nurse 
 Got the antidote, please show me where it hurts 
 Can you be my father, tell me what to do 
 You can punish me and maybe I will punish you 
 Sex, what do you know about sex 
 Tell me what you know about sex 
 Sex, what do you know about sex 
 Oh my God, you're so hot 
 Hold my hand, let me get on top 
 Oh my God, soaking wet 
 Back and forth 'til we break the bed 
 You got a bad attitude 
 I like to grant it on you 
 And when I let you put it on me 
 You better give me what I want baby 
 Oh my God 
 A lesson in sexology 
 Twisted rope, handcuffs, blindfolds, string of pearls 
 Neck ties, silk scarfs, silver chains, pretty girls 
 Thigh highs, leather mask, high heels, golden mask 
 Perfume, switch blade, absinthe, Novocaine 
 Chopsticks, underwear, barber soap, dental chair 
 Fish nets, satin sheets, garter belt, raw meat 
 Candle light, keyhole, leather belt, mink stole 
 Golden shower, latex thong, licorice whip, strap it on 
 Oh my God, you're so hot 
 Hold my hand, let me get on top 
 Oh my God, soaking wet 
 Back and forth 'til we break the bed 
 You got a bad attitude 
 I like to grant it on you 
 And when I let you put it on me 
 You better give me what I want baby
