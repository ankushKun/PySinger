Hey you, don't you give up 
 It's not so bad 
 There's still the chance for us 
 Hey you, just be yourself 
 Don't be so shy 
 There's reasons why it's hard 
 Keep it together, you'll make it alright 
 Our celebration is going on tonight 
 Poets and prophets would envy what we do 
 This could be good, hey you 
 Hey you, open your heart 
 It's not so strange 
 You've got to change this time 
 Hey you, remember this 
 None of it's real including the way you feel 
 Keep it together, we'll make it alright 
 Our celebration is going on tonight 
 Poets and prophets would envy what we do 
 This could be good, hey you 
 Save your soul, little sister 
 Save your soul, little brother 
 Hey you, save yourself 
 Don't rely on anyone else 
 First love yourself 
 Then you can love someone else 
 If you can change someone else 
 Then you have saved someone else 
 But you must first love yourself 
 Then you can love someone else 
 If you can change someone else 
 Then you have saved someone else 
 But you must first 
 Hey you, there on the fence 
 You've got a choice 
 One day, it will make sense 
 Hey you, first love yourself 
 Or if you can't 
 Try to love someone else 
 Keep it together, we'll make it alright 
 Our celebration is going on tonight 
 Poets and prophets will envy what we do 
 This could be good, hey you 
 First love yourself 
 Then you can love someone else 
 If you can change someone else 
 Then you have saved someone else 
 But you must first love yourself 
 Then you can love someone else 
 If you can change someone else 
 Then you have saved someone else 
 But you must first
