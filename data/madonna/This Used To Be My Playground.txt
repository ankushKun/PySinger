This used to be my playground 
 This used to be my childhood dream 
 This used to be the place I ran to 
 Whenever I was in need of a friend 
 Why did it have to end 
 And why do they always say 
 Don't look back, keep your head held high 
 Don't ask them why, because life is short 
 And before you know, you're feeling old 
 And your heart is breaking 
 Don't hold on to the past 
 Well, that's too much to ask 
 This used to be my playground (used to be) 
 This used to be my childhood dream 
 This used to be the place I ran to 
 Whenever I was in need of a friend 
 Why did it have to end 
 And why do they always say 
 No regrets 
 But I wish that you were here with me 
 Well then, there's hope yet 
 I can see your face in our secret place 
 You're not just a memory 
 Say goodbye to yesterday 
 Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say) 
 This used to be my playground (used to be) 
 This used to be our pride and joy 
 This used to be the place we ran to 
 That no one in the world could dare destroy 
 This used to be our playground (used to be) 
 This used to be our childhood dream 
 This used to be the place we ran to 
 I wish you were standing here with me 
 This used to be our playground (used to be) 
 This used to be our childhood dream 
 This used to be the place we ran to 
 The best things in life are always free 
 Wishing you were here with me
