I'm no stranger to deception 
 I have lied and been lied to 
 I'm no paragon of virtue 
 But I wanna be with you 
 I have never been a righteous soul 
 And I don't pretend I am 
 But I walk the line when I'm with you 
 Cause you make me believe I can 
 But we're running out of options 
 And we're running out of time 
 And I don't know if it's you or me 
 But it's time to speak your mind 
 Because I'm traveling across the sky 
 When you're with me, your hand in mine 
 Our honesty will make us fly 
 And we'll be traveling across sky 
 Across the sky (ooh) 
 Across the sky (ooh) 
 Across the sky (ooh) 
 Across the sky (ooh) 
 I'm not good at keeping quiet 
 And I can't keep this tied down 
 But it's got to count for something 
 That we're still hanging around 
 If you need an explanation for 
 What is false and what is true 
 Then I'd rather stop the world than think 
 That I could not be with you 
 But we're running out of options 
 And we're running out of time 
 And I don't know if it's you or me 
 But it's time to speak your mind 
 Because I'm traveling across the sky 
 When you're with me, your hand in mine 
 Our honesty will make us fly 
 And we'll be traveling across sky 
 Across the sky (ooh) 
 Across the sky (ooh) 
 Across the sky (ooh) 
 Across the sky (ooh) 
 Across the sky (ooh) 
 Traveling across the sky 
 Across the sky (ooh) 
 Traveling across the sky 
 Across the sky (ooh) 
 Traveling across the sky 
 Across the sky (ooh) 
 Traveling across the Sky
