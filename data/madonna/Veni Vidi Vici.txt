(Nas) 
 Madonna! 
 Life is so crazy 
 You've been through a lot 
 I tell your story sometimes, you know 
 Uh! 
 (Madonna) 
 Seem like yesterday, I was a baby on the street 
 I took a holiday, I was steppin' to the beat 
 I had to pay my rent, on the lower East side 
 I threw my tag around, let b-boys take me for a ride 
 I started writing songs, I kinda got into the groove 
 They tried to criticize my every single move 
 But then I realized I had nothing left to lose 
 It took me by surprise when I became my muse 
 I was fearless like a renegade 
 I had a feeling that I can't explain 
 I didn't listen to what people said (whatcha do) 
 I came, I saw, I conquered 
 I was constant as the northern star 
 I had a fire burning in my heart 
 I never gave up fighting in the dark 
 I came, I saw, I conquered (let's go) 
 Ooh I came, I saw, I conquered 
 Ooh I came, I saw, I conquered 
 I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle 
 Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile 
 And when it came to sex, I know I walked the borderline 
 And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind 
 I justified my love, I made you say a little prayer 
 They had me crucified, you know I had to take it there 
 I opened up my heart, I learned the power of good-bye 
 I saw a ray of light, music saved my life (music saved my life) 
 I was fearless like a renegade 
 I had a feeling that I can't explain 
 I didn't listen to what people said (whatcha do) 
 I came, I saw, I conquered 
 I was constant as the northern star 
 I had a fire burning in my heart 
 I never gave up fighting in the dark 
 I came, I saw, I conquered (let's go) 
 Uh I came, I saw, I conquered 
 Uh I came, I saw, I conquered 
 Nas: 
 In 1994, I came through the door 
 With that born beats versus scratches 
 Verbally murdered rappers 
 My mom's from the Carolina's, pops from Natchez 
 And QB's where I started flowing 
 But I was scared the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in 
 Had a baby girl by a crazy girl, then I got married 
 Heavily accosted, that ended in a bad divorce 
 And I know how to pick 'em, don't I? 
 Never gave a fuck about public pressure 
 Or the ridicule I'm too big to lose 
 Now who's the fool? 
 And I ain't never been happier, no lie 
 I'm just your humble servant, I'm Nas 
 If y'all burn down Ferguson, I'ma riot 
 My life cannot be compared to anybody 
 Any trapsters, and rappers 
 Any politicians, beauticians, a musician 
 Anybody, so I'm anybodies 
 Many coffins, heads or tails 
 Penny tosses, we either dead or in jail 
 Not many options on the block I came from 
 And I turned to a rap messiah, spit rapid fire 
 And I roll right back to the block I came from 
 I was fearless like a renegade 
 I had a feeling that I can't explain 
 I didn't listen to what people said (whatcha do) 
 I came, I saw, I conquered 
 I was constant as the northern star 
 I had a fire burning in my heart 
 I never gave up fighting in the dark 
 I came, I saw, I conquered (let's go) 
 Uh I came, I saw, I conquered 
 Uh I came, I saw, I conquered 
 Uh I came, I saw, I conquered 
 Uh I came, I saw, I conquered
