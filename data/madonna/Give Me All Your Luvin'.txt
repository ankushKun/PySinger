Nicki Minaj and M.I.A.: 
 L-U-V, Madonna 
 Y-O-U, you wanna 
 Madonna (Nicki Minaj and M.I.A.): 
 I see you coming and I don't wanna know your name 
 (L-U-V, Madonna) 
 I see you coming and you're gonna have to change the game 
 (Y-O-U, you wanna) 
 Would you like to try? 
 Give me a reason why 
 Give me all that you've got 
 Maybe you'll do fine 
 As long as you don't lie to me 
 And pretend to be what you're not 
 Don't play the stupid game 
 'Cause I'm a different kind of girl 
 Every record sounds the same 
 You've got to step into my world 
 Give me all your lovin', give me your love 
 Give me all your love today 
 Give me all your lovin', give me your love 
 Let's forget about time and dance our lives away 
 Nicki Minaj and M.I.A.: 
 L-U-V, Madonna 
 Y-O-U, you wanna 
 Madonna (Nicki Minaj and M.I.A.): 
 Keep trying, don't give up, it's if you want it bad enough 
 (L-U-V, Madonna) 
 It's right in front of you, now tell me what you're thinking of 
 (Y-O-U, you wanna) 
 In another place 
 At a different time 
 You can be my lucky star 
 We can drink some wine 
 Burgundy is fine 
 Let's drink the bottle every drop 
 Don't play the stupid game 
 'Cause I'm a different kind of girl 
 Every record sounds the same 
 You've got to step into my world 
 Give me all your lovin', give me your love 
 Give me all your love today 
 Give me all your lovin', give me your love 
 Let's forget about time and dance our lives away 
 Nicki Minaj: 
 Give me all your love boy 
 You could be my boy, you could be my boy toy 
 In the nick of time I could say a sicker rhyme 
 'Cause it's time for change like a nickel or a dime 
 I'm Roman, I'm a barbarian, I'm Conan 
 You was sleeping on me, you were dozin' 
 Now move, I'm goin' in 
 Madonna (Nicki Minaj): 
 You have all the L-U-V 
 I gave you everything you need (Now move!) 
 Now it's up to Y-O-U 
 Are you the one, shall we proceed? 
 M.I.A.: 
 Me eat, licks on sw-sw-swag shit 
 No one gives you this 
 It's supersonic, bionic, uranium hit 
 So I break 'em off tricks 
 Let's pray that it sticks 
 I'ma say this once, yeah I don't give a shit 
 Madonna (Nicki Minaj and M.I.A.): 
 Don't play the stupid game 
 'Cause I'm a different kind of girl 
 Every record sounds the same 
 You've got to step into my world 
 Give me all your lovin', give me your love 
 (L-U-V Madonna) 
 Give me all your lovin', give me your love 
 (Y-O-U you wanna) 
 Give me all your lovin', give me your love 
 Give me all your love today 
 Give me all your lovin', give me your love 
 Let's forget about time and dance our lives away
