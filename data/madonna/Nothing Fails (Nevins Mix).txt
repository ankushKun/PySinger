I'm in love with you, you silly thing 
 Anyone can see 
 What is it with you, you silly thing 
 Just take it from me. 
 It was not a chance meeting 
 Feel my heart beating 
 You're the one. 
 You could take all this, take it away 
 I'd still have it all 
 'Cause I've climbed the tree of life 
 And that is why, no longer scared if I fall. 
 When I get lost in space 
 I can return to this place 
 'Cause, you're the one. 
 Nothing fails, no more fears 
 Nothing fails, you washed away my tears 
 Nothing fails, no more fears 
 Nothing fails, nothing fails. 
 I'm not religious, but I feel so moved 
 Makes me want to pray 
 Pray you'll always be here 
 I'm not religious, but I feel such love 
 Makes me want to pray. 
 When I get lost in space 
 I can return to this place 
 'Cause you're the one. 
 I'm not religious, but I feel so moved, mmm 
 I'm not religious, makes me wanna pray 
 I'm not religious (I'm not religious) 
 But I feel so moved 
 Makes me want to pray (But I feel so moved, mmm) 
 Pray you'll always be here 
 I'm not religious (I'm not religious) 
 But I feel such love 
 Makes me want to pray (Makes me wanna pray) 
 Nothing fails, no more fears 
 Nothing fails, you washed away my tears 
 Nothing fails, no more fears, nothing fails... 
 Nothing fails, no more fears 
 Nothing fails, you washed away my tears 
 Nothing fails, no more fears, nothing fails... 
 Nothing fails, nothing fails, no more fears...
