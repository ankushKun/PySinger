We are amazed but not amused 
 By all the things you say that youll do 
 Though much concerned but not involved 
 With decisions that are made by you 
 But we are sick and tired of hearing your song 
 Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong 
 Cause if you really want to hear our views 
 You havent done nothin 
 Its not too cool to be ridiculed 
 But you brought this upon yourself 
 The world is tired of pacifiers 
 We want the truth and nothin else 
 And we are sick and tired of hearing your song 
 Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong 
 Cause if you really want to hear our views 
 You havent done nothin 
 Jackson 5 join along with me say 
 Doo doo wop  hey hey hey 
 Doo doo wop  whoa whoa whoa 
 Doo doo wop  co co co 
 Doo doo wop  na na na 
 Doo doo wop  bum bum bum 
 Doo doo wop 
 We would not care to wake up to the nightmare 
 Thats becoming real life 
 But when mislead who knows a persons mind 
 Can turn as cold as ice 
 Why do you keep on making us hear your song 
 Telling us how you are changing right from wrong 
 Cause if you really want to hear our views 
 You havent done nothin 
 Yeah 
 Jackson 5 sing along again say 
 Doo doo wop 
 Doo doo wop  oh

 Doo doo wop  co co co

 Doo doo wop  bum bum bum
