So sad her eyes 
 Smiling dark eyes 
 So sad her eyes 
 As it began 
 On such a breathless night as this 
 Upon my brow the lightest kiss 
 I walked alone 
 And all around the air did say 
 My lady soon will stir this way 
 In sorrow known 
 The white queen walks 
 And the night grows pale 
 Stars of lovingness in her hair 
 Heeding unheard 
 Pleading one word 
 So sad her eyes 
 She cannot see 
 How did thee fare what have thee seen 
 The mother of the willow green 
 I call her name 
 And 'neath her window have I stayed 
 I loved the footsteps that she made 
 And when she came 
 White queen how my heart did ache 
 And dry my lips no words could make 
 So still I wait 
 My goddess hear my darkest fear 
 I speak too late 
 It's forevermore that I wait 
 Dear friend goodbye 
 No tears in my eyes 
 So sad it ends as it began
