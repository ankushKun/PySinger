Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real, good time, I feel alive 
 And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah, I'm floating around in ecstasy 
 So, don't stop me now, don't stop me 
 'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time 
 I'm a shooting star, leaping through the sky like a tiger 
 Defying the laws of gravity 
 I'm a racing car, passing by like Lady Godiva 
 I'm gonna go, go, go, there's no stopping me 
 I'm burning through the sky, yeah 
 200 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit 
 I'm travelling at the speed of light 
 I wanna make a supersonic man out of you 
 Don't stop me now 
 I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball 
 Don't stop me now 
 If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call 
 Don't stop me now 
 'Cause I'm having a good time 
 Don't stop me now 
 Yes, I'm having a good time, I don't wanna stop at all, yeah 
 I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars on a collision course 
 I am a satellite, I'm out of control 
 I'm a sex machine, ready to reload like an atom bomb 
 About to whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode 
 I'm burning through the sky, yeah 
 200 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit 
 I'm travelling at the speed of light 
 I wanna make a supersonic woman of you 
 Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me, hey, hey, hey 
 Don't stop me, don't stop me, ooh-ooh-ooh, I like it 
 Don't stop me, don't stop me, have a good time, good time 
 Don't stop me, don't stop me, ahh 
 (Let loose, honey, all right) 
 Oh, I'm burning through the sky, yeah 
 200 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit, hey 
 Travelling at the speed of light
