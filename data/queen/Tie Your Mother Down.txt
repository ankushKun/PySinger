Get your party gown 
 And get your pigtail down 
 And get your heart beatin' baby 
 Got my timin' right 
 I got my act all tight 
 It's gotta be tonight 
 My little school babe 
 Your mama says you don't 
 And your daddy says you won't 
 And I'm boilin' up inside 
 Ain't no way I'm gonna lose out this time 
 Tie your mother down 
 Tie your mother down 
 Lock your daddy out of doors 
 I don't need him nosin' around 
 Tie your mother down 
 Tie your mother down 
 Give me all your love tonight 
 You're such a dirty louse 
 Go get outta my house 
 That's all I ever get from your 
 Family ties, in fact I don't think I ever heard 
 A single little civil word from those guys 
 I don't give a light 
 I'm gonna make out all right 
 I've got a sweetheart hand 
 To put a stop to all that 
 Snipin' and grousin' 
 Tie your mother down 
 Tie your mother down 
 Take your little brother swimmin' 
 With a brick (that's all right) 
 Tie your mother down 
 Tie your mother down 
 Or you ain't no friend of mine 
 Your mommy and your daddy 
 Gonna plague me till I die 
 They can't understand it 
 I'm just a peace lovin' guy 
 Tie your mother down 
 Tie your mother down 
 Get that big big big big big big 
 Daddy out the door 
 Tie your mother down yeah 
 Tie your mother down 
 Give me all your love tonight 
 All your love tonight 
 (Give me every inch of your love)
