Music is playing in the darkness 
 And a lantern goes swinging by 
 Shadows flickering 
 My heart's jittering 
 Just you and I 
 Not tonight 
 Come tomorrow 
 When everything's sunny and bright (sunny and bright) 
 No no no 
 Come tomorrow 
 'Cause then we'll be waiting for the moonlight 
 We'll go walking in the moonlight 
 Walking in the moonlight 
 Laughter ringing in the darkness 
 People drinking for days gone by 
 Time don't mean a thing 
 When you're by my side 
 Please stay awhile 
 You know I never could forsee the future years 
 You know I never could see where life was leading me 
 But will we be together for ever 
 What will be my love, can't you see that I just don't know 
 No no not tonight 
 Come tomorrow 
 Everything's gonna be fine (sunny and bright) 
 Wait and see 
 If tomorrow 
 We'll be as happy as we're feeling tonight 
 We'll go walking in the moonlight (oh, we'll be happy, we'll be happy) 
 Walking in the moonlight 
 I can hear the music in the darkness 
 Floating softly to where we lie 
 No more questions now 
 Let's enjoy tonight (Just you and I) 
 Just you and I 
 Just you and I 
 Can't you see that we've gotta be together 
 Be together, just you and I, just you and I 
 No more questions, just you and I
