Buddy you're a boy make a big noise 
 Playing in the street gonna be a big man some day 
 You got mud on yo' face 
 Big disgrace 
 Kicking your can all over the place 
 We will we will rock you (come on) 
 We will we will-- 
 Buddy you're a young man hard man 
 Shouting in the street gonna take on the world some day 
 You got blood on yo' face 
 A big disgrace 
 Waving your banner all over the place 
 We will we will rock you (sing it everyone) 
 We will we will rock you 
 We will we will rock you (come on) 
 We will we will-- 
 Buddy you're an old man, poor man 
 Pleading with your eyes gonna make you some peace some day 
 Got mud on yo' face 
 Big disgrace 
 Somebody better put you back into your place 
 We will we will rock you (yeah yeah) 
 We will we will-- 
 Rock you, rock you, rock you, rock you 
 We will we will rock you 
 Rock you! 
 Spoken, beginning 
 Queen:Let Me Entertain You 
 Hello everybody, feeling good? 
 Are you ready to rock? Are you ready to roll?
