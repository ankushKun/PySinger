Taylor (spoken): 
 Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Hilton 
 Um, I met him a couple months ago 
 Doing a show out in California 
 Um and I had met him because he had said some nice things about me in a magazine and said "Ya know I'm a really big fan of Taylor Swift's music" and I read that and I'm like wow that's really cool so I had my management contact his management and he arranged to come be at one of my shows.And so, ya know, I asked him to come out and sing with me.And while he was standing there next to me on stage I said "Tyler, how would you like to be in one of my music videos?" And uh, the crowd, he was kinda silent but the crowd was like "Yeah! Oh my God!" You guys know how to do that? 
 Crowd: 
 Woo! 
 Taylor (Spoken): 
 That's what I like to hear. Anyways, so he's standing here on stage and I'm like straight up "Do you wanna be in a music video? I'm shooting one in a couple weeks. And uh he goes "Well, I guess. Yeah sure." Because I mean the crowd was going so loud that if he would have said no they would have probably booed him off the stage. Which was kinda my point and asking him on stage. So basically I forced him to be in my music video.Have y'all seen that one? Would y'all like me to bring him out and do a song with him? Tyler Hilton's in the house tonight! So uh, the song I asked to sing with him um a couple months ago when we had a show together was one that he sings on One Tree Hill. Ya see, Tyler is on the show One Tree Hill because he's cool. He was also in the movie Walk The Line, he played Elvis Presley.So I decided to go all out for my hometown. So uh, Tyler ya gonna sing a song with me? 
 Tyler (spoken): 
 Yeah 
 Let's do it! 
 If ya guys know, sing along too. 
 Taylor: 
 Everytime I think of you 
 I always catch my breath 
 I'm still standing here 
 And your miles away 
 And I wonder why you left me 
 And there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight 
 Tyler: 
 I hear your name in certain circles 
 And it always makes me smile 
 I spent my time just thinkin' about you 
 And its almost driving me wild 
 But it's my heart that's beggin down this long distance line tonight 
 Both: 
 And I ain't missin' you at all 
 Since you've been gone... Away 
 I ain't missin' you 
 No matter what I might say 
 Tyler: 
 There's a message in the wires 
 And I am sendin' you a signal tonight 
 You don't know how desperate I've become 
 And It looks like I'm loosein' this fight 
 But it's my heart that's breakin' down this long dusty road of mine 
 Both: 
 But I ain't missin' you at all 
 Since you've been gone... Away 
 I ain't missin' you at 
 No matter what my friends say 
 Taylor: 
 And there's a message that I'm sendin' out 
 Like a telograph to you or something 
 I can't bridge this distance 
 Honey, stop this heart ache all alone 
 Both: 
 I ain't missin' you at all 
 Since you've been gone... Away 
 I ain't missin' you 
 No matter what my friends say 
 I ain't missin' you 
 Since you've been gone... Away 
 I ain't missin' you 
 Yeah, no matter what your friends say 
 Hey yeah, yeah yeah yeah 
 I ain't missin' you at all 
 Since you've been gone... Away 
 I ain't missin' you 
 No 
 Taylor (Spoken):
