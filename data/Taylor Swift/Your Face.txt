I heard a song tonight on the radio 
 Another girl sings about a boy 
 She sees his face in every space, every room 
 And I know that if I turn around you won't be there 
 If I close my eyes, will you be there? 
 I don't wanna lose your face 
 And I don't wanna wake up one day 
 And not remember what time erased 
 I don't wanna turn around 
 'Cause I'm not scared of what love gave me and took away 
 And I don't wanna lose your face... 
 I've got a picture of you in my bedroom 
 And I hope it never falls 
 I hope I never lose that feelin' 
 I used to get when you called 
 And then I wonder to myself 
 Who are you, where are you, where you ever here at all? 
 I don't wanna lose your face 
 And I don't wanna wake up one day 
 And not remember what time erased 
 I don't wanna turn around 
 'Cause I'm not scared of what love gave me and took away 
 And I don't wanna lose your face... 
 That girl in the song had it so good 
 I wish I could close my eyes and see you 
 I wish the sky had your face 
 And the oceans had your eyes 
 And the sunset had your lips 
 And I had you... 
 Oh, yeah 
 I don't wanna lose your face 
 And I don't wanna wake up one day 
 And not remember what time erased 
 And I don't wanna turn around 
 'Cause I'm not scared of what love gave me and took away 
 And I don't wanna lose your face 
 Oh, no, no 
 I don't wanna lose your face 
 I don't wanna turn around
