She said "I was seven and you were nine 
 I looked at you like the stars that shine 
 In the sky 
 The pretty lights 
 And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us 
 Growing up and falling in love 
 And our mamas smiled 
 And rolled their eyes 
 And said "Oh, my, my, my" 
 Took me back to the house and the backyard trees 
 Said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me 
 You never did 
 You never did 
 Took me back when the world was one block wide 
 I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried 
 Just two kids 
 You and I 
 Oh, my, my, my 
 Well I was sixteen when suddenly 
 I wasn't that little girl you used to see 
 But your eyes still shined 
 Like pretty lights 
 And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us 
 They never believed we'd really fall in love 
 And our mamas smiled 
 And rolled their eyes, 
 And said "Oh, my, my, my" 
 Took me back to the creek beds we turned up 
 Two A.M. running in your truck 
 And all I need is you next to me 
 Took me back to the time we had our very first fight 
 Slamming up doors instead of kissing goodnight 
 You stayed outside 
 Till the morning light 
 Oh, my, my, my 
 A few years have gone and come around 
 We were sitting at our favorite spot in town, 
 And you looked at me 
 Got down on one knee 
 Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle 
 Our whole town came 
 And our mamas cried 
 You said "I do" 
 And I did too 
 Take me home where we met so many years before 
 We'll rock our babies on the very front porch 
 After all this time 
 You and I 
 I'll be eighty seven 
 You'll be eighty nine 
 I'll still look at you like the stars that shine 
 In the sky 
 Oh, my, my, my
