One, two, three, four, 
 Before I know it, I'm out the door 
 Five, six, seven, eight, 
 Oh, why, didn't I, wait? 
 Nine and ten, 
 I sure do regret, then 
 Oh wait! 
 For another chance 
 You need, 
 To take a risk 
 So hey, 
 Just wait! Before it is too late, 
 Just take, a chance 
 So tell, me why, 
 It takes me time, 
 To wonder how, 
 How I got this far 
 But why, didn't I wait? 
 There was a chance, I needed to take! 
 Oh wait! 
 For another chance, 
 You need, 
 To take a little risk 
 So hey! 
 Just wait! 
 Before it's too late 
 Just take, a chance 
 : 
 So imagine, what it would be like, 
 If we never took risks, 
 Or we never had a chance 
 To 
 Live 
 La la la la, la la la la la la, la la la la, la la la la oh oh 
 Oh wait! 
 For another chance 
 You need, 
 To take a risk 
 So hey, 
 Just wait! 
 Before it is too late, 
 Just take, a chance 
 Oh oh
