If there's a plane or a bus leavin' Dallas 
 I hope you're on it 
 If there's a train movin' fast down the tracks 
 I hope you caught it 
 'Cause I swear out there ain't where 
 You outta be 
 So catch a ride or catch a cab 
 Don't you know that I miss you bad? 
 But don't you walk to me 
 Baby, run 
 Cut a path across the blue sky 
 Straight in a straight line 
 You can't get here fast enough 
 Find a truck and fire it up 
 Lean on the gas and off the clutch 
 Leave Dallas in the dust 
 I need you in a rush 
 So, baby, run 
 So, baby, run 
 Oh, if you ain't got a suitcase 
 Get a box 
 Or an old brown paper sack 
 And pack it light, or pack it heavy 
 Take a truck, take a Chevy 
 Baby, just come back 
 There's a short cut to the highway out of town 
 Why don't ya take it? 
 Don't let that speed limit slow ya down 
 Go on and break it 
 Baby, break it 
 And run 
 Cut a path across the blue sky 
 Straight in a straight line 
 You can't get here fast enough 
 Find a truck and fire it up 
 Lean on the gas and off the clutch 
 Leave Dallas in the dust 
 I need you in a rush 
 So baby run 
 Run to me 
 Baby, run 
 Run to me 
 So, baby, run 
 Run 
 Oh, baby, run
