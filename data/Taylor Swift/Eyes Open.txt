Everybody's waiting 
 Everybody's watching 
 Even when you're sleeping 
 Keep your eyes open 
 The tricky thing 
 Is yesterday we were just children 
 Playing soldiers, just pretending 
 Dreaming dreams with happy endings 
 In backyards 
 Winning battles with our wooden swords 
 But now we've stepped into a cruel world 
 Where everybody stands and keeps score 
 Keep your eyes open 
 Everybody's waiting for you to break down 
 Everybody's watching to see the fallout 
 Even when you're sleeping, sleeping 
 Keep your eyes open 
 Keep your eyes open 
 Keep your eyes open 
 So here you are 
 Two steps ahead and staying on guard 
 Every lesson forms a new scar 
 They never thought you'd make it this far 
 But turn around 
 Oh, they've surrounded you with a showdown 
 And nobody comes to save you now 
 But you got something they don't, yeah, you got something they don't 
 You just gotta keep your eyes open 
 Everybody's waiting for you to break down 
 Everybody's watching to see the fallout 
 Even when you're sleeping, sleeping 
 Keep your eyes open 
 Keep your eyes open 
 Keep your eyes 
 Keep your feet ready 
 Heartbeat steady 
 Keep your eyes open 
 Keep your aim locked 
 The night grows dark 
 Keep your eyes open 
 Keep your eyes open 
 Keep your eyes open 
 Keep your eyes open 
 Everybody's waiting for you to break down 
 Everybody's watching to see the fallout 
 Even when you're sleeping, sleeping 
 Keep your eyes open 
 Keep your eyes open 
 Keep your eyes open 
 Keep your eyes open 
 Keep your eyes open
