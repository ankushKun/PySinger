The way you love is like a full on rainstorm 
 And I'm a house of cards 
 You're the kind of reckless that you send me runnin' 
 But I kind of know that I won't get far 
 And you stood there in front of me just 
 Close enough to touch 
 Close enough to hope you couldn't see 
 What I was thinking of 
 Drop everything now 
 Meet me in the pouring rain 
 Kiss me on the sidewalk 
 Take away the pain 
 Cause' I see sparks fly 
 Whenever you Smile 
 Get me with those green eyes, baby 
 As the lights go down 
 Gimme something little hot 
 For when you'r not around 
 Cause' I see sparks fly 
 Whenever you Smile 
 My mind forgets to advise me 
 You're a bad idea 
 You touch me once and 
 It's really something 
 You find I'm even better 
 Than you imagined I would be 
 I'm on my guard with the rest of the world 
 But with you I know it's no good 
 And I could wait patiently but I 
 I really wish you would 
 Drop everything now 
 Meet me in the pouring rain 
 Kiss me on the sidewalk 
 Take away the pain 
 Cause' I see sparks fly 
 Whenever you smile 
 Get me with those green eyes baby 
 As the lights go down 
 Gimme something little hot 
 For when you're not around 
 Cause' I see sparks fly 
 Whenever you Smile 
 I run my fingers through your hair 
 And watch the lights go wild 
 Just keep on keeping your eyes on me 
 It's just wrong enough to make it feel right 
 And lead me up the staircase slowly 
 And whisper something slow 
 ??????? 
 Like a firework show 
 Drop everything now 
 Meet me in the pouring rain 
 Kiss me on the sidewalk 
 Take away the pain 
 Cause' I see sparks fly 
 Whenever you smile 
 Get me with those green eyes baby 
 As the lights go down 
 Gimme something little hot 
 For when you're not around 
 'Cause I see sparks fly 
 Whenever you 
 Smile 
 And the sparks fly 
 Yeah baby smile 
 And the sparks fly 
 Yeah
