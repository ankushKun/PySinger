I said I know 
 He said I need some time, need some space 
 To think about all of this 
 I watched him go 
 He watched me crash to the floor 
 On my knees, just like that 
 He said, "When can I come back?" 
 I said, that's when I wake up in the morning 
 That's when after sun is always storming 
 Laughing when I'm crying 
 And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate 
 That's when if I see your face 
 I'll let you in, baby that's when 
 I said I know 
 He said I did you wrong, made mistakes 
 Put you through all of this 
 'Cause I let you go, you let me think 
 That I'll be fine without you 
 Imagine that 
 So baby when can I come back 
 I said, that's when I wake up in the morning 
 That's when after sun is always storming 
 Laughing when I'm crying 
 That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate 
 That's when if I see your face 
 I'll let you in, baby that's when 
 And I said all this playing 
 Did you ever think of me 
 And he said 
 That's when I woke up in the morning 
 That's when after sun is always storming 
 Laughing when I was crying 
 That's when we were waiting at the front gate 
 That's when, when I saw your face 
 You let me in, and baby that's when 
 I said I know 
 He said I need some time, need some space
