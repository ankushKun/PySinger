You say you want to wait to get married, 
 Why you in a pause, 
 You say it's not your time yet, 
 When is the perfect time for you 
 Just let me go, tell me I'm not the one for you 
 Tell me you found someone else in your life 
 Tell me I wasn't good enough for you 
 But don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore 
 What changed your mind in two days 
 Did I do something wrong to make you put a hold 
 On our future, 
 It was just a week ago when you asked me 
 What date I plan to ask you the big question, 
 Why did you do this to me 
 Just let me go, tell me I'm not the one for you 
 Tell me you found someone else in your life 
 Tell me I wasn't good enough for you 
 But don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore 
 It was perfectly set how it would go down 
 All our dream would have come real 
 Now you put them in a coffin and put the dirt on them 
 Should just add a stone to them and make it read 
 Here lies the dreams of a fallen futures, 
 Just let me go, tell me I'm not the one for you 
 Tell me you found someone else in your life 
 Tell me I wasn't good enough for you 
 But don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore 
 Why did yo do this 
 Now I stand here with this ring, flowers, and dirt on my knees 
 Tears falling down my eyes with humiliation, 
 It might as well just rain and have lightning strike and miss me, 
 Tonight isn't a lucky night, 
 Now I can't look you in the eyes any more, 
 Just go ahead and walk away 
 Just leave me here in my misery of shame, 
 Just let me go, tell me I'm not the one for you 
 Tell me you found someone else in your life 
 Tell me I wasn't good enough for you 
 Don't say you're sorry 
 And don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore 
 You say you want to wait to get married 
 You say you're not ready yet 
 You say today isn't good enough for you 
 Do me a favor and do put me on hold, 
 Because I don't want to anymore
