Well, I saw the things you were doing at the VMAs 
 And when I got that video award, you took the mic away 
 Now, I'll try to call security with every step I take 
 And nothing will even stop with all the music that I ever make 
 Don't think you're gonna win this time 
 'Cause you better believe that you're not what you do 
 I'll get ya! (yeah) 
 I'll get ya! (yeah) 
 And when I do, Kanye you'll be busted 
 I don't wanna be mean to you 
 But you better believe me when I tell you that 
 You are never what you do 
 You're busted. (Busted!) 
 Yeah, everybody makes mistakes 
 But, this is how it's gonna be until you apologize on the VMAs 
 You're busted!
