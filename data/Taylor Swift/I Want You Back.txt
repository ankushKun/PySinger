Oh baby give me one more chance 
 (I'll show you that I love you) 
 I want you please let me 
 Back in your heart 
 Oh darling I was blind to let you go 
 (Let you go baby) 
 Now that I see you in her arms 
 I want you back 
 I want you back 
 I want you back 
 I want you back, oh baby 
 I want you back 
 I want you back 
 I want you back 
 Oh whoa-oh 
 Oh baby give me one more chance 
 (I'll show you that I love you) 
 I want you please let me 
 Back in your heart 
 Oh darling I was blind to let you go 
 (Let you go baby) 
 Now that I see you in her arms
