Both: 
 Girl put your records on 
 Kellie: 
 Tell me your favorite song 
 Both: 
 You go ahead let your hair down 
 Kellie: 
 Sapphire and faded jeans 
 Both: 
 I hope you get your dreams 
 Kellie: 
 Go ahead leave your hair down 
 Kellie: 
 American girls 
 And American guys 
 Will always stand up and salute 
 Will always recognize 
 When they see old glory flyin 
 There's a lot of men dead 
 So we can sleep in peace at night 
 When we lay down our head 
 Taylor: 
 My daddy served in the army 
 When he lost his right eye 
 But he flew a flag out in our yard 
 Till the day that he died 
 He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister, and me 
 To grow up and live free 
 Both: 
 Hey 
 Uncle Sam put your name 
 At the top of his list 
 And the statue of Liberty 
 Started shaking her fist 
 And the eagle will fly 
 And it's gonna be hell 
 When you hear mother freedom 
 Start ringing her bell 
 And it'll feel like 
 The whole wide world 
 Is raining down on you 
 Oh brought to you courtesy 
 Of the red, white, and blue 
 Kellie: 
 Oh 
 Justice will be served 
 And the battle will rage 
 Both: 
 This big dog 
 Kellie: 
 Will fight 
 When you rattle his cage 
 Taylor: 
 You'll be sorry 
 That you messed with 
 The U.S. of 
 Both: 
 We'll put a red high heel 
 In your ass 
 It's the American way 
 Now Uncle Sam 
 Put your name 
 At the top of his list 
 And the statue of Liberty 
 Started shaking her fist 
 And the eagle will fly 
 And it's gonna be hell 
 When you hear mother freedom 
 Start ringing her bell 
 And it'll feel like 
 The whole wide world 
 Is raining down on you 
 Oh ooh 
 Brought to you courtesy 
 Of the red, white, and blue
