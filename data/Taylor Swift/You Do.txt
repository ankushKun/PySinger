Do you still have that dream, 
 That dream of you and me, 
 The dream that got us this far, 
 That got us to where we are. 
 Do you still want the same 
 As you used to, 
 Do you still want a me and you, 
 Baby I don't wanna waste my 
 Time but I don't wanna let go, 
 Let go, oh, let go, no, no I don't wanna let go. 
 Don't wanna leave you, 
 A just wanna keep you, forever till the end but baby 
 Baby please don't pretend, 
 That you truly still love me, 
 I know that your above, if 
 We can make this work - I will, 
 But tell do you love me still? tell me baby do you? 
 Be honest boy, do you want this, 'cause I can't see a future ahead of this no more, you can just go and walk out the door, don't tell lies, please don't play games, the thought of what's goin' on, drivin' me insane, and if you must, go find another girl you love and lust, but baby I still ... 
 Don't wanna leave you, 
 A just wanna keep you, forever till the end but baby 
 Baby please don't pretend, 
 That you truly still love me, 
 I know that your above, if 
 We can make this work - I will, 
 But tell do you love me still? tell me baby do you? 
 Am takin' by that look on your face, am takin' that it's over, 
 Though I need you more than anything or anyone, I suppose I'll let it all go, but forever baby, my love for you will always grow, but one more time, so I know for sure, 
 Are you ready to walk away? 
 Leave me behind and forget 
 Our time everday? do you still want me, I know you will say no, but baby if you really don't love me, then just go, 
 But I still ... 
 Don't wanna leave you, 
 A just wanna keep you, forever till the end but baby 
 Baby please don't pretend, 
 That you truly still love me, 
 I know that your above, if 
 We can make this work - I will, 
 But tell do you love me still? tell me baby do you?
