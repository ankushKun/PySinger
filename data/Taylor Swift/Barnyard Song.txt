You turn your dial to 93.7 
 Broadway acts like he's 11 
 Self-proclaimed 
 Say's he's the worst mistake ever to land in Michigan 
 I'm just a singer of country songs 
 Just trying to play guitar and not do no wrong 
 But if you listen to just one thing I say 
 You should turn Z93 on 
 Broadway's Electric Barnyard 
 I sing a song called Tim McGraw 
 Request it and they'll play it all day long 
 I sing in stations all day long 
 But there's nothin' like when you're on 
 The Electric Barnyard 
 Daisy's from a trailer park in St. Louis 
 Growin' up not wearin' any shoes 
 Prettiest hillbilly girl you see all day 
 Growin' up the other trailer park girls 
 Couldn't hide their jealousy 
 'Cause she had the only phone for miles 
 Now she uses it as a DJ 
 So you should turn Z93 on 
 Broadway's Electric Barnyard 
 I sing a song called Tim McGraw 
 Request it and they'll play it all day long 
 I sing in stations all day long 
 But there's nothin' like when you're on
