Please take down the mistleoe 
 'Cause I don't wanna think about that right now 
 Cause everything I want is miles away 
 In a snow covered little town 
 Mama's in the kitchen worrying about me 
 Seasons greetings hope you're well 
 I'm doing all right if you were wondering 
 Lately I can never tell 
 I know this shouldn't be a lonely time 
 But there were Christmases when you were mine 
 I've been doing fine without you, really 
 Up until the nights got cold 
 Eveybody's here except you, baby 
 Seems like everyon's got someone to hold 
 But for me it's just a lonely time 
 Cause there were Christmases when you were mine 
 Merry Christmas everynbody 
 That'll have to be something I just say this year 
 Bet you got your mom another sweater 
 Were your cousins late again? 
 When you were putting up the lights this year 
 Did you notice one less pair of hands? 
 I know this shouldn't be a lonely time 
 But there were Christmases whe I didn't 
 Wonder how you are tonight
