This melody is what your love means to me 
 I love you so much babe can't you see 
 It is like a rainbow after the thunderstorm 
 Your love aways kept me safe and warm, 
 You had to walk through that open door 
 I suddenly fell down to the floor 
 It hurt so much to live without you 
 I tried not to think about you 
 You were more than I ever had 
 My love for you still makes me glad 
 So please come back we could start anew 
 No more sitting around feeling blue 
 So come on, it wil be just me and you 
 Don't hesitate 
 It would be great 
 It's not too late 
 Lets celebrate!
