Now that he's back in the atmosphere 
 With drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey 
 He acts like summer and walks like rain 
 Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey 
 Since his return from the stay on the moon 
 He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey 
 Tell me did you sail across the sun 
 Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights are faded 
 And that heaven is overrated 
 Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star 
 One without a permanent scar 
 And did you miss me while you were looking at yourself out there 
 Now that he's back from that soul vacation 
 Tracing his way through the constellation, hey, hey 
 He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo 
 Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey 
 Now that he's back in the atmosphere 
 I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain ol' Jane 
 Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land 
 Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet 
 Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day 
 And head back to the Milky Way 
 And tell me, did Venus blow your mind 
 Was it everything you wanted to find 
 And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 
 Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken 
 Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong 
 Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance, five-hour phone conversation 
 The best soy latte that you ever had in May 
 Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet 
 Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day 
 And head back to the Milky Way 
 And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star 
 One without a permanent scar 
 And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself 
 Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, oh 
 Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, oh 
 Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken 
 Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong 
 Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance, five-hour phone conversation 
 The best soy latte that you ever had in May
