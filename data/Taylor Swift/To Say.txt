You take all the words you said to her and put them up as a wall of gray, 
 Protecting yourself from the world that you believe in, 
 I didn't know you would be able to say all the things you did so I take them and put them up as a wall of gray, 
 Protecting myself from the world I believe in 
 She didn't have a reason to cry like she did over you, 
 While you ignored the world and listend to the fray, 
 And you said you wouldn't be imbarassed if you said that word again but we both go imbarassed when we said her name 
 The words written on the wall didn't have anything against anybody, 
 We're not in a war so what are we fighting for, 
 I don't know so just shut-up and say all the thing you've wanted to say, 
 The page filled with words in gray and it's about you 
 I've never been anywhere cold as you, 
 You give rainy endings to perfect days, 
 That's why I hate you for who you are 
 If you were the only thing I needed we wouldn't be this way, 
 So she just said everything, everybody wanted her to say, 
 But I'm not gonna say it oh, no, no, no 
 She didn't have a reason to cry like she did over you, 
 You promised me everything I wanted but you gave it to everybody else instead, 
 But you never gave us a damn thing so we cry, 
 Cry alone or is it together I don't know
