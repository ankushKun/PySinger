Flashing lights and we 
 Took a wrong turn and we 
 Fell down the rabbit hole 
 You held on tight to me 
 'Cause nothing's as it seems 
 I'm spinning out of control 
 Didn't they tell us don't rush into things? 
 Didn't you flash your green eyes at me? 
 Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds? 
 Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting? 
 I felt your arms twisting around me 
 I should've slept with one eye open that night 
 We found Wonderland 
 You and I got lost in it 
 And we pretended it 
 Could last forever, eh 
 We found Wonderland 
 You and I got lost in it 
 And life was never worse 
 But never better, eh 
 In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh 
 In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh 
 In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh 
 In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh 
 So we went on our way 
 Too in love to think straight 
 All alone or so it seemed 
 But there were strangers watching 
 And whispers turned to talking 
 And talking turned to screams 
 Oh, didn't they tell us, "Don't rush into things?" 
 Didn't you flash your green eyes at me? 
 Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile? 
 Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting? 
 I felt your arms twisting around me 
 It's all fun and games till somebody loses their mind 
 Oh, darling, we found Wonderland 
 You and I got lost in it 
 And we pretended it 
 Could last forever, eh 
 We found Wonderland 
 You and I got lost in it 
 And life was never worse 
 But never better, eh 
 In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh 
 In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh 
 In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh 
 In Wonderland 
 I reach for you, but you were gone 
 I knew I had to go back home 
 You searched the world for something else 
 To make you feel like what we had 
 And in the end, in Wonderland 
 We both went mad 
 We found Wonderland 
 You and I got lost in it 
 And we pretended it 
 Could last forever 
 (last forever) 
 We found Wonderland 
 You and I got lost in it 
 And life was never worse 
 But never better 
 (never better) 
 We found Wonderland 
 You and I got lost in it 
 And we pretended it 
 Could last forever 
 We found Wonderland 
 You and I got lost in it 
 And life was never worse 
 But never better 
 In Wonderland
