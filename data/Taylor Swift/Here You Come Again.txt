Here you come again 
 Just when I'm about to get myself together 
 You waltz right through the door 
 Just like you've done before 
 And wrap my heart 'round your little finger 
 Here you come again 
 Just when I'm about to make it work without you 
 You look into my eyes, and light those dreamy eyes 
 And pretty soon I'm wonderin' 
 How I came to doubt you 
 All you gotta do 
 Is smile that smile, and there go all my defenses 
 Just leave it up to you, and in a little while 
 You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses 
 Here you come again 
 Lookin' better than a body has the right to 
 And shakin' me up so 
 That all I really know 
 Is here you come again 
 All you gotta do 
 Is smile that smile, and there go all my defenses 
 Just leave it up to you, and in a little while 
 You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses 
 Here you come again 
 Lookin' better than a body has the right to 
 And shakin' me up so that all I really know 
 Is here you come again 
 And here I go 
 And here you come again 
 And here I go, oh, oh 
 And here I go 
 And here you come again 
 And here I go, oh, no 
 And here I go
