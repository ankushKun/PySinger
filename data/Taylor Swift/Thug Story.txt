 : 
 Hey, Hey 
 T-Swizzle, T-Pizzle 
 Taylor Swift 
 : 
 I'm like 8 foot 4, blond hair to the floor 
 You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore 
 No I ain't got a gun 
 No I never really been in a club 
 Still live with my parents 
 But I'm still a thug 
 I'm so gangsta you can find me baking cookies at night 
 You out clubbing, but I just made caramel delight 
 T-Pain 
 :
