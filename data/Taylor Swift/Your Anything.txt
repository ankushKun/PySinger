I betchya lie awake at night 
 Tryin' to make up your sweet mind 
 Wonderin if you'll ever find 
 Just what you want 
 A home-town number one 
 Or a California loaded gun 
 But you know you only get one 
 Or that's what you thought 
 But here's what you've got 
 I could be your baby blue jeans 
 With the holes in the knees 
 In the bottom of the top drawer 
 I could be your little beauty queen 
 Just a little outta reach 
 Or the girl livin' next door 
 I'll be your angel givin' up her wings 
 If that's whatchya need 
 I'd give everything to be your anything 
 If you want hard to get 
 If you want... 
 All you have to do is let me know 
 If you want a bumpy ride 
 Or someone with a softer side 
 Either one'll be all right 
 Just let me know 
 Cause this is where it goes 
 I could be your baby blue jeans 
 With the holes in the knees 
 In the bottom of the top drawer 
 I could be your little beauty queen 
 Just a little outta reach 
 Or the girl livin' next door 
 I'll be your angel givin' up her wings 
 If that's whatchya need 
 I'd give everything to be your anything 
 It's not like I'm givin' up who I am for you 
 But for someone like you it's just so easy to do 
 I could be your baby blue jeans 
 With the holes in the knees 
 In the bottom of the top drawer 
 I could be your little beauty queen 
 Just a little outta reach 
 Or the girl livin' next door 
 I'll be your angel givin' up her wings 
 If that's whatchya need... 
 If that's whatchya need 
 I could be your baby blue jeans 
 With the holes in the knees 
 In the bottom of the top drawer 
 I could be your little beauty queen 
 Just a little outta reach 
 Or the girl livin' next door 
 I'll be your angel givin' up her wings 
 If that's whatchya need
