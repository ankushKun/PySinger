She didn't have a reason to go, oh no 
 She didn't have a reason to stay 
 Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun, 
 She looked at her keys and found a reason to run 
 And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound, 
 But I understand it somehow 
 If I could drive all night 
 Would I find my peace of mind 
 Would it be a million miles of cold white lies 
 An unfamiliar exit sign 
 If I just drive on by, 
 Just south of knowing why 
 I didn't really know her that well, 
 But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind. 
 She felt so out of touch, just felt too much 
 If you don't know what you want, nothings ever enough 
 And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound, 
 That's where I'm headed right now 
 If I could drive all night 
 Would I find my peace of mind 
 Would it be a million miles of cold white lies 
 An unfamiliar exit sign 
 If I just drive on by, 
 Just south of knowing why 
 I don't have a plan 
 I don't have a map 
 I don't even know if I'm ever going back 
 I don't have a when 
 And I don't have a where 
 I don't even know if I'm knowing I'm there 
 And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound, 
 But I understand it somehow 
 But If I could drive all night 
 Would I find my peace of mind 
 Would it be a million miles of cold white lies 
 An unfamiliar exit sign 
 If I just drive on by, 
 Just south of knowing why 
 I just drive on by 
 Drive on 
 Drive on 
 Drive all night 
 If I drive on 
 Drive on 
 Drive on 
 Drive all night 
 Just south of knowing why
