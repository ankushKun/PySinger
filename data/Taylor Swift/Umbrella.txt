When the sun shines 
 We'll shine together 
 Told you I'll be here forever 
 Said I'll always be your friend 
 Took an oath 
 I'mma stick it out till the end 
 Now that it's raining more than ever 
 Know that we still have each other 
 You can stand under my Umbrella 
 You can stand under my Umbrella 
 (Ella ella eh eh eh) 
 Under my umbrella 
 (Ella ella eh eh eh) 
 Eh eh 
 You had my heart 
 And we'll never be world apart 
 Maybe in magazines 
 But you'll still be my star 
 Baby cause in the Dark 
 You can see shiny Cars 
 And that's when you need me there 
 With you I'll always share 
 Because 
 When the sun shines 
 We'll shine together 
 Told you I'll be here forever 
 Said I'll always be your friend 
 Took an oath 
 I'mma stick it out till the end 
 Now that it's raining more than ever 
 Know that we still have each other 
 You can stand under my Umbrella 
 You can stand under my Umbrella 
 (Ella ella eh eh eh) 
 Under my umbrella 
 (Ella ella eh eh eh) 
 Eh eh 
 These fancy things 
 Will never come in between 
 You're part of my entity 
 Here for Infinity 
 When the war has took it's part 
 When the world has dealt it's cards 
 If the hand is hard 
 Together we'll mend your heart 
 Because... 
 When the sun shines 
 We'll shine together 
 Told you I'll be here forever 
 Said I'll always be your friend 
 Took an oath 
 I'mma stick it out till the end 
 Now that it's raining more than ever 
 Know that we still have each other 
 You can stand under my Umbrella 
 You can stand under my Umbrella 
 (Ella ella eh eh eh) 
 Under my umbrella 
 (Ella ella eh eh eh)
