If you love me then I love you 
 Swear by the freckles on the moon 
 And maybe this will be enough 
 I'd like to keep you till I'm old 
 But if I can't at least I'll know 
 That baby, Perfect Have I Loved 
 Do you remember the stupid things we used to do? 
 Before September stole me away from you 
 The time we got your truck stuck in the creek 
 'Cause baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me 
 Sayin' 
 If you love me then I love you 
 Swear by the freckles on the moon 
 And maybe this will be enough 
 I'd like to keep you till I'm old 
 But if I can't at least I'll know 
 That baby, Perfect Have I Loved 
 I used to see you by the bridge we used to cross 
 I found the feeling of trying to get lost 
 You would smile that smile that I tried so hard to forget 
 It's hard to douse a fire that I still haven't put out yet 
 And if you love me then I love you 
 Swear by the freckles on the moon 
 And maybe this will be enough 
 I'd like to keep you till I'm old 
 But if I can't at least I'll know 
 That baby, Perfect Have I Loved 
 Love was all we knew 
 And faith was growing on the vines 
 Words were all we had 
 And for one Summer you were mine 
 Sayin' 
 If you love me then I love you 
 Swear by the freckles on the moon 
 And maybe, this will be enough 
 I'd like to keep you till I'm old 
 But if I can't at least I'll know 
 That baby, Perfect Have I Loved
