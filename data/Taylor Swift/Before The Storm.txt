Taylor: 
 I know this isn't what I wanted, 
 Never thought it'd come this far, 
 Just thinking back to where we started 
 And how we lost all that we are 
 Nick: 
 We were young and times were easy, 
 But I could see it's not the same. 
 I'm standing here but you don't see me, 
 I'd give it all for that to change. 
 And I don't want to lose her, 
 I don't want to let her go. 
 Taylor: 
 I'm standing out in the rain, 
 I need to know if it's over, 
 'Cause I will leave you alone. 
 Nick: 
 Flooded with all this pain, 
 Knowing that I'll never hold her, 
 Like I did before the storm 
 Nick: 
 And with every strike of lightning 
 Taylor: 
 Comes a memory that lasts 
 Nick Taylor: 
 Not a word is left unspoken as the thunder starts to crash 
 Taylor: 
 Maybe I should give up 
 Taylor: 
 I'm standing out in the rain, 
 I need to know if it's over, 
 'Cause I will leave you alone. 
 Nick: 
 Flooded with all this pain, 
 Knowing that I'll never hold her, 
 Like I did before the storm 
 Taylor: 
 Trying to keep the light from going in 
 Nick and Taylor: 
 And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart. 
 We always say a heart is not whole without the one who gets you through the storm. 
 Standing out in the rain, knowing that it's really over- please don't leave me alone 
 Flooded with all this pain, knowing that I'll never hold you, like I did before the storm 
 Like I did before the storm
