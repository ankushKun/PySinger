 I drive around this town in a mustang with the top down 
 And six running horses under my hood 
 Well that's good enough for me 
 I don't need the real thing 
 That's just another thing for me to try to tame 
 I don't know if I could' it might just break me 
 I thought there for a little while every sunset 
 I'd be riding off with him 
 Snap buttons on a denim shirt 
 Blue jeans and a little dirt 
 That's the closest you'll see me 
 Feet hanging out a pickup truck 
 Crazy and a little rough' running free 
 That's the closest to a cowboy you'll see me 
 Before I met him I was so safe and grounded 
 Before he taught me how to lie and crawl out the window 
 I learned the dirt roads and I got my heart broken 
 Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry 
 And how to let go 
 I thought there for a little while every sunset 
 I'd be riding off with him 
 Snap buttons on a denim shirt 
 Blue jeans and a little dirt 
 That's the closest you'll see me 
 Feet hanging out a pickup truck 
 Crazy and a little rough' running free 
 That's the closest to a cowboy you'll see me 
 It was all a bit wonderful and strange 
 But I'll never look at a sunset the same 
 Snap buttons on a denim shirt 
 Blue jeans and a little dirt 
 That's the closest you'll see me 
 Feet hanging out a pickup truck 
 Crazy and a little rough' running free 
 Sitting fishing by the riverbank 
 Swimming in the water tank 
 That's the closest you'll see me 
 Feet hanging out a pickup truck 
 Crazy and a little rough' running free 
 That's the closest you'll see me
