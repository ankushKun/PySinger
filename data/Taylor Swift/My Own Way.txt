I don't want to break your heart 
 But you just keep on pushing me 
 I want to walk away 
 But you have ways of stopping me 
 I don't know what to say 
 Its just that I really want to leave 
 Cause your holding me back, holding me back from the life of luxury 
 So let me go my own way 
 Opposite from you 
 I don't care what you have to say 
 My hearts not in the mood 
 Though I really love you 
 You just keep hurting me 
 You say tell you what to do to make me happy 
 The only way is for you to let me leave 
 When ever we go out 
 I'm just a friend to you 
 But when we at home 
 You want to call me your boo 
 An I hate the fact 
 That when she comes around you make me go away 
 It's like you can't make up your mind 
 This is all I have to say 
 So let me go my own way 
 Opposite from you 
 I don't care what you have to say 
 My hearts not in the mood 
 Though I really love you 
 You just keep hurting me 
 You say tell you what to do to make me happy 
 The only way is for you to let me leave 
 You say I can count on you 
 But you just playing games 
 An I just let it slide 
 When call her name 
 You don't get it 
 I'm trying so hard not to walk away 
 But see now I'm tired of your two faces 
 So I'm just going to go my own way 
 So let me go my own way (My own way) 
 Opposite from you (From you, from you, from you) 
 I don't care what you have to say 
 My hearts not in the mood (Not in the mood) 
 Though I really love you 
 You just keep hurting me (You just keep hurting me) 
 You say tell you what to do to make me happy 
 The only way is for you to let me leave (Let me leave) 
 So let me go my own way 
 Opposite from you 
 I don't care what you have to say 
 My hearts not in the mood 
 Though I really love you 
 You just keep hurting me 
 You say tell you what to do to make me happy 
 The only way is for you to let me leave 
 Let me leave, an go my own way 
 Let me leave, an go my own way 
 Let me leave, an go my own way 
 Let me leave, an go my own way
