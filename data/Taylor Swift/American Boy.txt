American boy, living life as it goes 
 Sittin' on the fence posts 
 Living in the lie 
 American boy, living in the real world 
 Trying just to get the girl 
 Trying to survive 
 The simple things in life are always new 
 Growing up on Sam Hill avenue 
 Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just 
 The greatest living hero that ever was 
 Nothing in the world can ever once destroy 
 The hope of an American boy 
 Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships 
 Looking for the love 
 Suddenly rise, an American beauty 
 Suddenly he cheats, sent from above 
 The simple things in life are always new 
 Growing up on Sam Hill avenue 
 Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just 
 The greatest living hero that ever was 
 Nothing in the world can ever once destroy 
 The dream of an American boy 
 American boy, raising little babies 
 Hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you 
 Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn 
 That's grown up, American boy 
 The simple things in life are always new 
 Growing up on Grandview avenue 
 Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just 
 The greatest living hero that ever was 
 Nothing in the world will ever once destroy 
 No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy 
 The hope of an American boy
