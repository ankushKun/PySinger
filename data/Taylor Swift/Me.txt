I am moving through the crowd 
 Trying to find myself 
 Feel like a guitar that's never played 
 Will someone strum away? 
 And I ask myself 
 Who do I wanna be? 
 Do I wanna throw away the key? 
 And invent a whole new me 
 And I tell myself 
 No One, No One 
 Don't wanna be 
 No One 
 But me... 
 You are moving through the crowd 
 Trying to find yourself 
 Feelin' like a doll left on a shelf 
 Will someone take you down? 
 And you ask yourself 
 Who do I wanna be? 
 Do I wanna throw away the key? 
 And invent a whole new me 
 Gotta tell yourself 
 No One, No One 
 Don't wanna be 
 No One 
 But me... 
 Your life plays out on the shadows of the wall 
 You turn the light on to erase it all 
 You wonder what it's like to not feel worthless 
 So open all the blinds and all the curtains 
 No One, No One 
 Don't wanna be 
 No One 
 But me... 
 We are moving through the crowd...
