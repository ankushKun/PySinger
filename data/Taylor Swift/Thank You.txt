spoken: 
 This one goes out to all my fans! 
 I'd just like to say 
 How everyday 
 You guys make life rock 
 I depend on you 
 For your support 
 And what do ya know 
 You were always there 
 When I needed you 
 And in return I'd like to say 
 Thank you 
 For everything 
 I wouldn't be here without you 
 Thank you 
 I love you all 
 Each one another 
 I just wanna say 
 Thank you 
 Thank you today 
 I can't believe that you all 
 Helped me come this far 
 I think that's 
 The greatest thing ever 
 I couldn't ask for more 
 And I appreciate it 
 Thank you 
 For everything 
 I wouldn't be here without you 
 Thank you 
 I love you all 
 Oh yeah 
 Thank you all
