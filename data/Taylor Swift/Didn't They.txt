She walks to school with her arms crossed 
 It's just another day 
 At 10 o'clock she hears the screaming 
 Then finally she sees them 
 It's scary how things change 
 And I saw the story on the news 
 I saw the footage from the roof 
 I sat down and cried 
 Didn't she call you 
 Didn't she need you bad enough? 
 Was there some reason 
 Another way up? 
 Did you not write it down 
 Just one more thing to do 
 Where were you 
 And didn't she pray too? 
 He kissed his wife goodbye 
 And took the earliest flight 
 So he could be home that night 
 To put his kids to sleep 
 Down the aisle 
 Three men walked and said 
 "We're here to die for our God" 
 He stood up and said, "That's funny 
 'Cause my God died for me" 
 I put the magazine down 
 I read his words out loud 
 I sat down and cried 
 Didn't he call you 
 Didn't he need you bad enough? 
 Was there some reason 
 Another way up? 
 Did you not write it down 
 Just one more thing to do 
 Where were you 
 And didn't he pray too? 
 The taxis were full up 
 On the very day of 
 The rope 100 floors up 
 Just to come back down 
 They never thought they'd see the day 
 The, the tower'd be up in flames 
 There was nothing left to say 
 When it all came down 
 And didn't they call you 
 Didn't they need you bad enough? 
 Was there some reason 
 Another way up? 
 Did you not write it down 
 Just one more thing to do 
 Where were you? 
 Where were you? 
 And didn't they pray, oh 
 I walk to school and I wear a cross 
 I'm counting every day
