Untouchable like a distant diamond sky. 
 I'm reachin' out and I just can't tell you why. 
 I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you. 
 Untouchable burning brighter than the sun, 
 And when you're close I feel like coming undone. 
 In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream 
 It's like a million little stars spelling out your name 
 You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together, 
 Come on, come on, little taste of heaven. 
 It's half full and I won't wait here all day. 
 I know you're sayin' that you'd be here anyway. 
 But you're untouchable burning brighter than the sun, 
 Now that you're close I feel like coming undone. 
 In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream 
 It's like a million little stars spelling out your name 
 You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together, 
 Come on, come on, oh 
 In the middle of the night we could form this dream. 
 I wanna feel you by my side, standin next to me. 
 You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together. 
 Come on, come on, little taste of heaven. 
 Oh, Oh. 
 I'm caught up in you. 
 Oh, Oh, Oh. 
 Untouchable burnin brighter than the sun, 
 And when you're close I feel like comin' undone. 
 You gotta, come on, come on, say that we'll be together, 
 Come on, come on, oh 
 In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream 
 It's like a million little stars spellin out your name 
 You gotta, come on, come on, say that we'll be together, 
 Come on, come on, little taste of heaven.
