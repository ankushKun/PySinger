She acts like she's 5 years old 
 Since it's cold she's got her big coat on 
 I hear people laugh at her 
 I look up bored 
 And she cries and runs 
 We start throwing stuff at her and she tries to hide 
 This starts to get old 
 She hugs her legs 
 And we put her to sleep 
 I'm forced to take her home 
 And she's stupid to not know why the trees change in the fall. 
 And I know that she is scared 
 Of every little thing and all 
 She thinks snow whites house very near how dumb 
 But I know we had the worst day 
 Ever today. 
 She starts acting like she's 13 and thinks everyone is mean 
 She starts crying 
 And I push her away 
 And cut her with my keys 
 And she starts to drive and drive until she found a town far enough away 
 And she sulks and walks and tries to forget all our names 
 And she know if she's ever going to finish school 
 And she knows shell never laugh 
 'Cause we shrunk and she grew 
 She don't know how long it'll take to feel okay 
 But she knows she had the wors day ever today 
 She had a bullying father 
 She thought she was getting stronger 
 Her mom beats up her little brother 
 Inside and out hes more popular than she is 
 She grew up in an ugly house 
 And had no space to run 
 And she had the worst days with me 
 There was a video I found from back when we were three 
 She was trying to paint in the kitchen and she was talking to me 
 It was the age of teasing and bullying and throwing eggs at her window 
 And her dad was super dumb 
 And I was the most handsome boy 
 In the whole wide world 
 And now she knows why 
 All the trees change in the fall 
 And she knows I was never on her side 
 And always said she was wrong 
 And she hates me 
 For giving her the evil eyes 
 And making her feel like 
 She could shine 
 And I don't know if she knew 
 So I'm taking this chance to say 
 That I always have the worst days 
 When I'm with you.
