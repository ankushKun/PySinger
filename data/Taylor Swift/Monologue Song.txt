I like glitter and sparkly dresses 
 But I'm not gonna talk about that 
 In my monologue 
 I like baking and things that smell like winter 
 But I'm not gonna talk about that 
 In my monologue 
 La la la, 
 La la la 
 I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me 
 But I'm not gonna say that 
 In my monologue 
 I like writing their names into songs 
 So that they're ashamed to go in public 
 But I'm not gonna say that 
 In my monologue 
 La la, 
 La la la la la 
 This is my musical monologue! 
 You might think I'd bring up Joe 
 That guy who broke up with me on the phone 
 But I'm not gonna mention him 
 In my monologue 
 Hey Joe, I'm doing real well 
 Tonight I'm hosting SNL 
 But I'm not gonna brag about that 
 In my monologue 
 La la la, ha ha ha 
 Ha ha ha, ha ha ha, la la la 
 And if you're wondering if I might 
 Be dating the werewolf from Twilight 
 I'm not gonna comment on that 
 In my monologue 
 La la, 
 La la la la la 
 This is my musical monologue 
 You might be expecting me to say 
 Something bad about Kanye 
 And how he ran up on the stage 
 And ruined my VMA monologue 
 But there's nothing more to say 
 Cause every thing's okay 
 I've got security lining the stage 
 It's my SNL monologue 
 La la, 
 La la la la la 
 This is my SNL monologue 
 La la, 
 La la la la la 
 That was my SNL monologue
