I shined your shoes 
 I poured the wine 
 I gave you all of my time 
 I patched your fake smile 
 Against your friends 
 Which apparently is a crime 
 I gave you space 
 You took my place 
 And gave it to her 
 But life's too long 
 To waste it all loving a liar 
 And when love hands me matches now 
 I'm gonna burn it down 
 I keyed her car 
 Got my guitar 
 And wrote this damn song 
 Look what you've found 
 She's been around 
 I hear the lines long 
 And don't you tell me 
 To be nice 
 I'm not a nice girl 
 She died from complications 
 Of the things you told her 
 So when love hands me matches now 
 I'm gonna burn it down 
 Ain't it funny 
 You said honey 
 You meant sitting duck 
 Well I say cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver 
 Just a few I've thought of 
 And when love hands me matches now 
 'Gonna burn it down 
 I'm gonna burn it down 
 Oh yeah 
 Gonna burn it, burn it, burn it down 
 Matches, now
