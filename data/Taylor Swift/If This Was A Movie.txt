Last night I heard my own heart beating 
 Sounded like footsteps on my stairs 
 Six months gone and I'm still reaching 
 Even though I know you're not there 
 I was playing back a thousand memories, baby 
 Thinking about everything we've been through 
 Maybe I've been going back too much lately 
 When time stood still and I had you 
 Come back, come back, come back to me like 
 You would, you would if this was a movie 
 Standing in the rain outside until I came out 
 Come back, come back, come back to me like 
 You could, you could if you just said you're sorry 
 I know that we could work it out somehow 
 But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now 
 I know people change and these things happen 
 But I remember how it was back then 
 Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing 
 Because nothing like this ever happened to them 
 Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street 
 Flashback to the night when you said to me 
 That nothing's going to change, not for me and you 
 That before I knew how much I had to lose 
 Come back, come back, come back to me like 
 You would, you would if this was a movie 
 Standing in the rain outside until I came out 
 Come back, come back, come back to me like 
 You could, you could if you just said you're sorry 
 I know that we could work it out somehow 
 But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now 
 If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on 
 I've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone 
 I just want it back the way it was before 
 And I just want to see you back at my front door 
 And I'd say 
 Come back, come back, come back to me like 
 You would before you said it's not that easy 
 Before the fight, before I let you walk 
 But I take it all back now 
 Come back, come back, come back to me like 
 You would, you would if this was a movie 
 Standing in the rain outside until I came out 
 Come back, come back, come back to me like 
 You could, you could if you just said you're sorry 
 I know that we could work it out somehow 
 But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now 
 You'd be here by now 
 It's not the kind of ending you'd want to see now 
 Baby, what about the ending 
 I thought you'd be here by now 
 Thought you'd be here by now
