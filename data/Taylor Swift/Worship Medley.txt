Jesus, Jesus, precious is your name 
 When you dwell in the fullness 
 Of your trinity the Lord 
 Crush me till the oil flows like rain 
 Healing my pain 
 Let the oil flow like rain 
 Crush me till the oil flows like rain 
 Healing my pain 
 Let the oil flow like rain 
 There's a healing in the house 
 Healing in the house 
 He has come to mend the broken-hearted 
 Healing in the house 
 There is joy in the house 
 Joy in the house 
 He has come to mend the broken-hearted 
 Joy in the house 
 There is joy in the house 
 Joy in the house 
 He has come to mend the broken-hearted 
 Joy in the house 
 Blessed be the father, the god of all creation 
 Blessed be the father, who reigns forevermore 
 Who reigns forevermore...
