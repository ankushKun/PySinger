I can't believe you did it again, walk by and took my heart with you 
 Why'd you have to look so good, don't you know I'm trying to hate you 
 Tryin' to have a dream without you in it, but how can I put out this fire 
 When you're the one that lit it? 
 I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not 
 I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, until I do 
 I keep writing songs about you 
 I got a stack of papers so high and it's all about you baby 
 Keep thinking maybe I can make sense of something crazy 
 Something I can get out of my head 
 I write your name, I write your name, and I tear it all to shreds 
 I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not 
 I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, until I do 
 I keep writing songs about you 
 And if you ever change your mind you want me back again 
 I hope these songs will remind me why I shouldn't let you in 
 I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay, 'cause I'm not 
 I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, till I do 
 I'll just wait for the day, I'll stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not 
 I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, till I do 
 I keep writing songs about you.
