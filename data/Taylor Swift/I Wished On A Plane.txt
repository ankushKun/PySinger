Throwing pennies at the fountain 
 But when you're standing on the mountain 
 It's kinda hard to aim 
 Like the tree we cut our names in, 
 There must be an explanation 
 Guess it didn't get enough rain 
 I need reasons why you're leaving 
 When I guess I wished on a plane, I thought it was a star 
 I guess what you wrote on the paper wasn't really in your heart 
 'Cause I swore when you said that you loved me, 
 Guess I heard you wrong 
 And I guess I wished on a plane, and I thought it was a star
