 We can step it up just a little bit of a notch. We can step it up I think. And I want you to sing along. To every song that I sing that you know please. As loud as you possibly can. I will not get offended. I think one of the cool things about being able to play guitar is that you can play whatever you want. And uh, you can play songs that you wrote or you can play songs that other people wrote or you can play country songs or you can play, you can play this. 
 To the left 
 To the left 
 Everything you own 
 In the box to the left 
 In the closet 
 That's my stuff 
 Yes, if I bought it 
 Please don't touch 
 Keep talking and yes that's fine 
 Could you walk and talk 
 At the same time and 
 It's my name that's on the tag 
 Come in with your bags 
 Let me call you a cab 
 Standin in the front yard 
 Tellin' me how I'm such a fool 
 How I'm never gonna find a man 
 Like you 
 Got me twisted 
 You must know 'bout me 
 You must not know 'bout me 
 I can have another you 
 In a minute 
 Matter fact 
 He'll be here in a minute 
 Baby 
 You must not know 'bout me 
 You must not know 'bout me 
 I can have another you by tomorrow 
 So don't you 
 Ever for a second get to thinking 
 You're irreplaceable 
 So 
 Go ahead and get gone 
 Call up that chick 
 And see if she's home 
 Oops I bet you thought 
 That I didn't know 
 What'd ya think 
 I was putting you out for 
 'Cause you were untrue 
 Haulin her around in the truck 
 That I bought you 
 Baby drop them keys 
 Hurry up before your taxi leaves 
 Standin in the front yard 
 Tellin' me 
 How I'm such a fool 
 Talkin' bout 
 How I'll never find a man like you 
 Got me twisted 
 You must not know 'bout me 
 You must not know 'bout me 
 I can have another you in a minute 
 Matter fact 
 He'll be here in a minute 
 Baby 
 You must not know 'bout me 
 You must not know 'bout me 
 I can have another you by tomorrow 
 So don't you ever for a second 
 Get to thinking 
 You're irreplaceable 
 Yeah
