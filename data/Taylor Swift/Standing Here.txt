You were the guy I always dreamed of. 
 You were the guy that I loved. 
 But then you had to leave me. 
 I asked when you would call me. 
 You replied meet me at the wildernes at nine. 
 I went there standin waitin to see your face... 
 You never showed up I was there for hours, I was waitin to see your face. 
 I'll stand here for hours under this lonely spot light. 
 I'll wait all night till I see your face. 
 Oh waitin to see your face. 
 I went to the mall with all my friends to see if you were there 
 I saw you with another girl 
 I didn't think to swear. 
 I went home crying to see if you were there 
 If a message was left I would cry my tears. 
 I was watin to see your face. 
 I'll stand here for hours under this lonely spot light. 
 I'll wait all night till I see your face. 
 Oh waitin to see your face. 
 Then I had your call for me and I saw your face lookin' at me 
 I was glad to see! 
 We went we cried to the the wilderness---I'm not alone... 
 Under the spot light any more... 
 Any more--- any more--- ANY MORE!
