You see me giving people weird looks, I can't help it is ma face, 
 My kind is the odd and quiet type, but I can be loud when I want to, 
 Don't be a racist idiot, you hate the nazis too, 
 You're just a fat guy who needs a life, but I'm not helping that task 
 You tell all your friends that I am real strange, 
 You can't talk 'cause your gay, 
 Fat gay, fat lad, fat man, hanging on the wall, 
 You need give me space, ortherwise I will... Nut you. 
 You call me a phyco, you don't know what your saying, 
 You call me every name under the starlit sky, 
 Get a life, that's worth living, your making mine like hell. 
 Don't be gay, oops wait, your bi-sexual, 
 Don't be stupid and wreck your life, 
 Go away DJ, I ain't that phyco, who nutted that lad under the old bridge, 
 Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone!
