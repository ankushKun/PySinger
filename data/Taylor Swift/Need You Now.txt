Need you now 
 Read letters that I wrote on the wall 
 And the message I left on my car 
 Need you now 
 Word I said drowned out by the rain 
 Waiting there for you but you never came 
 My world's a little colder now 
 But I'm keeping warm somehow 
 So here you are at my window 
 Guess nobody told you 
 I don't need you, don't need you 
 And I waited so frustrated 
 Who's gonna hold you 
 I don't need you, don't need you 
 Now 
 Need you now 
 Words I heard you whisper to me 
 We were walking down a one way street 
 You need me now 
 That's what you've been telling my friends 
 But I've come too far to go back there again 
 My heart and my number has changed 
 You might as well forget my name 
 So here you are at my window 
 Guess nobody told you 
 I don't need you don't need you 
 And I waited so frustrated 
 So who's gonna hold you 
 I don't need you don't need you now 
 And I'm not what you want 
 I won't wonder where you are 
 I won't dream a thousand stars 
 I don't need you now 
 I don't need you by the rain 
 And I never heard you say 
 I need you, I need you 
 I don't need you now 
 Don't need you 
 I don't need you now
