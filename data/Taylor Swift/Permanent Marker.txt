I know he loved you 
 A long time ago 
 I ain't jealous of you 
 Just thought you should know 
 You were never good enough for him 
 Or anything like me 
 So you might as well sit back 
 'Cause I ain't tryin' to show maturity 
 X is the shape I drew 
 Through your face 
 In permanent marker 
 Oh ya 
 Just like the mark you knew you were makin' 
 Who do you think you are 
 To write on his heart 
 In permanent marker 
 I found those pictures 
 Of you in that green dress 
 Sure had a good time 
 Cleaning up that mess 
 He found 30 other pieces 
 But he'll never find them all 
 Tried to tape them back together 
 Now he knows to keep it off the wall 
 X is the shape I drew 
 Through your face 
 In permanent marker 
 Oh ya 
 Just like the mark you knew you were makin' 
 Who do you think you are 
 To write on his heart 
 In permanent marker 
 X is the shape I drew 
 Through your face 
 In permanent marker 
 Oh ya 
 Just like the mark you knew you were makin' 
 Who do you think you are 
 To write on his heart 
 In permanent marker 
 Well I don't appreciate you callin him to reminisce 
 The only reason is your seeing is how much better off he is 
 X is the shape I drew 
 Through your face 
 In permanent marker 
 Oh ya 
 Just like the mark you knew you were makin' 
 Who do you think you are 
 To write on his heart 
 In permanent marker 
 X is the shape I drew 
 Through your face 
 In permanent marker 
 Oh ya 
 Just like the mark you knew you were makin' 
 Who do you think you are 
 To write on his heart 
 X is the shape I drew 
 Through your face 
 In permanent marker 
 Oh ya 
 Just like the mark you knew you were makin' 
 Who do you think you are 
 To write on his heart 
 In permanent marker 
 X is the shape I drew 
 Through your face 
 In permanent marker 
 Oh ya 
 Just like the mark you knew you were makin' 
 Who do you think you are 
 To write on his heart 
 In Permanent marker 
 In permanent Marker
