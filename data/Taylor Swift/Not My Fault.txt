(Talking) 
 Wow it's been at least 5 years since I've seen her. Pfft it's hard to believe 
 (Singing) 
 I can't believe it's been that long, why didn't your call, why didn't you write. 
 Was it cause of him or was it just cause you don't love me anymore. 
 You could have found some way of contact me. 
 But I know it's not my fault 
 Once he's gone I know you'll start to come around 
 I know it's his fault now, you should have told me sooner, I wouldn't have had to live my life this way 
 Now that he's gone will I get to see you again 
 At least hear your voice again 
 I think it's gonna workout this time around 
 We can be a family again not like before is gonna be different, 
 We're gonna do lot's of stuff together I think it's gonna work out this time around not like before 
 But I know it's not my fault 
 Once he's gone I know you'll start to come around 
 I know it's his fault now, you should have told me sooner 
 I wouldn't have had to live my life this way 'cause I know it's not my fault now
