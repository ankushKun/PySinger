I never saw it coming 
 The look in your eyes, showed me no surprise 
 You walked me to the front door and said 
 I love you and I'd never break your heart 
 You were so perfect 
 You really lead me on 
 And gave me everything I ever wanted 
 Going out for dinner every night 
 Cuddling while were watching our favorite movies 
 Going out to the football games 
 And then talking till sunrise 
 You gave me this and put me down 
 I really thought we would improve 
 But you were the one, the one 
 That I fell for 
 Going out for dinner every night 
 Cuddling while were watching our favorite movies 
 Going out to the football games 
 And then talking till sunrise 
 You gave me this and put me down 
 You were the one 
 That lead me on 
 So here I go 
 I hope she's worth it 
 Going out for dinner every night 
 Cuddling while were watching our favorite movies 
 Going out to the football games 
 And then talking till sunrise 
 You gave me this and put me down 
 Oh Oh Oh 
 You were unperfect
