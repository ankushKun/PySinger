Well she was an American girl 
 Raised on promises 
 She couldn't help thinking that there 
 Was a little more to life 
 Somewhere else 
 After all it was a great big world 
 With lots of places to run to 
 Yeah, and if she had to die 
 Tryin-she had one little promise 
 She was gonna keep 
 Oh yeah, all right 
 Take it easy baby 
 Make it last all night 
 She was an American girl 
 Well it was kind of cold that night 
 She stood alone on her balcony 
 And she could the cars roll by 
 Out on 441 
 Like waves crashin on the beach 
 And for one desperate moment there 
 He crept back in her memory 
 God it's so painful 
 Something that's so close 
 And still so far out of reach 
 Oh yeah, all right 
 You take it easy baby 
 Make it last all night 
 She was an American girl 
 Oh yeah, all right 
 Take it easy baby 
 Make it last all night 
 Oh yeah, all right 
 Take it easy baby 
 Oh, take it easy now 
 Oh yeah, all right 
 She was an American girl
