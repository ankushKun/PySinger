I like the way you wanted me 
 Every night for so long baby 
 I like the way you needed me 
 Every time things got rocky 
 I was believing in you 
 Was I mistaken do you mean 
 Do you mean what you say 
 When you say our love could last forever 
 But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie 
 I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye 
 I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know 
 But baby don't you break my heart slow 
 I like the way you'd hold me 
 Every night for so long baby 
 I like the way you'd sing to me 
 Every time things got rocky 
 I was believing in you 
 Was I mistaken do you say 
 Do you say what you mean 
 When you say our love could last forever 
 'Cause I'd rather you be mean than love and lie 
 I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye 
 I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know 
 But baby don't you break my heart slow 
 You would run around and lead me on forever 
 While I stay at home still thinking we're together 
 I wanted our love to last forever 
 But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie 
 I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye 
 I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know 
 But baby don't you break my heart slow 
 Baby don't you break my heart slow
