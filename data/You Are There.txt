You are there like the laughter of a child 
 When I need just a smile 
 Suddenly the sun shines for a while 
 Everywhere sounds of love are everywhere 
 And my heart sings along 
 Thanks to you I finally got a song 
 Cause you are there 
 You are there 
 You are there somewhere 
 Each time my world seems like its falling down 
 Things look up just having you around 
 So every night I say a prayer 
 Just because youre there 
 Like a rainbow after rain 
 Like the night follows day 
 Youre the answer to the prayers I say 
 And you are there 
 You are there 
 You are there somewhere 
 No matter where I go or what I do 
 You are there to help me see it trough 
 So every night I say a prayer 
 Just because youre there 
 Ouuh you are there 
 Ooh you are there somewhere 
 And as the years go by well stay as true 
 What you are for me Ill be for you 
 And every night Ill say a prayer 
 Just because youre there 
 Ooh you are there 
 Ooh you are there 
 Everywhere you are there
