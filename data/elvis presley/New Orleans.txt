You'll never know 
 What heaven means 
 Until you've been down to new orleans 
 You ain't been livin' till you cuddle and coo 
 With some black-eyed baby by de old bayou 
 You've never seen 
 You've never seen those cupid doll queens 
 Like they got 'em in new orleans 
 And, ooh, they love you like no-one can 
 It makes you awful glad that you were born a man. 
 If-if-if you ain't been there 
 Then you ain't been nowhere 
 The livin's lazy and the lovin's fine 
 If you feel low down 
 So help me hannah 
 You should lose the blues in loui-si-i-si-ana. 
 Get the lead 
 Get the lead out of your jeans 
 And hot foot it down, hot foot down to where? 
 New orleans 
 Louisiana baby tells you stay awhile 
 Live it up, love it up, southern style 
 Way down in new new orleans.
