Oh break it, burn it, drag it all around 
 Twist it, turn it, you can't tear it down 
 'Cause every minute, every hour you'll be shaken 
 By the strength and mighty power of my love 
 Crush it, kick it, you can never win 
 I know baby you can't lick it 
 I'll make you give in 
 Every minute, every hour you'll be shaken 
 By the strength and mighty power of my love 
 Baby I want you, you'll never get away 
 My love will haunt you yes haunt you night and day 
 Touch it, pound it, what good does it do 
 There's just no stoppin' the way I feel for you 
 'Cause every minute, every hour you'll be shaken 
 By the strength and mighty power of my love 
 Yeah, yeah, baby I want you, you'll never get away 
 My love will haunt you yes haunt you night and day 
 Touch it, pound it, what good does it do 
 There's just no stoppin' the way I feel for you 
 'Cause every minute, every hour you'll be shaken 
 By the strength and mighty power of my love 
 I said every minute, every hour you'll be shaken 
 By the strength and mighty power of my love 
 Every minute, every hour you'll be shaken 
 By the strength and mighty power of my love
