I will be true 
 No matter what they may say 
 I will be true 
 Although you're far far away 
 Each night I pray 
 All day I'll say a silent prayer 
 That when I open my door 
 I'll find you there 
 Somehow I feel 
 That someday we'll meet again 
 Don't ask me how 
 It's something I can't explain 
 Until the day 
 I give up all hope of you 
 Assure yourself this I'll do 
 I will be true 
 Oh oh mmmmmmm 
 That someday we'll meet again 
 Don't ask me how 
 It's something I can't explain 
 Until the day 
 I give up all hope of you 
 Assure yourself this I'll do 
 I will be true
