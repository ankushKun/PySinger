The clock by the bed is ticking too loud in the quiet night 
 I lie in the darkness thinking I must go before it's light 
 Before you open up your eyes and you beg me to stay 
 I'll leave 'cause I can't stand to see you hurt this way 
 Sleep my love as I kiss you goodbye 
 Then I won't hear the sound of your cry 
 Though I knew the time was coming and our love would end somehow 
 I just couldn't bear to tell you exactly just when or how 
 I know we can't go on, that it was wrong to start 
 But if you wake up crying now, you know you'll break my heart 
 Sleep my love as I kiss you goodbye 
 Then I won't hear the sound of your cry 
 Sleep my love as I kiss you goodbye 
 Then I won't hear the sound of your cry 
 Oh, Sleep my love as I kiss you, kiss you, kiss you goodbye 
 Then I won't hear the sound of your cry 
 Oh, Sleep my love as I kiss you
