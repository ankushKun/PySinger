I've got to find my baby 
 I wonder where can she be 
 Has anybody seen her? 
 Send her back to me 
 She left me here all alone 
 And I ain't had no lovin', 
 (hey hey hey) 
 Since my baby's been gone 
 My baby's gone 
 I've gotta find my baby 
 I gotta hold her tight 
 And tell her I love her 
 That everything's alright 
 So I'll keep searching all night long 
 'Cause I ain't had no lovin', 
 (hey hey hey) 
 Since my baby's been gone 
 My baby's gone 
 I've gotta find my baby 
 I've gotta find my baby 
 Gotta find my baby
