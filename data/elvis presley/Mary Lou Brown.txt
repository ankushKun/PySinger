I'll hold you tight in the moonlight tonight 
 I love you Mary Lou Brown 
 Twinkeling stars told the milky white way 
 That I marry Mary Lou Brown 
 And I will tell all the world 
 Of my young Southern girl, 
 See her tonight beyond moonlight 
 So I can hold Mary tight 
 I'll bring my guitar to the moonlight tonight 
 I love you Mary Lou Brown 
 Imagine your heart floating right up the sigh (?) 
 I love you Mary Lou Brown 
 Down by the green river side with my arms open wide 
 I'll wait for her, only for her 
 Mary Lou Brown's mine tonight 
 Mary Lou Brown's mine tonight
