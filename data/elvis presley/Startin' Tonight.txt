Michigan state, comity 
 Harvard university 
 Vasser, Wilbur, Smith and Brown 
 Shakin' up this here town tonight 
 Startin' tonight 
 Have a ball do it all 
 Startin' tonight 
 Grab your partner by the hand 
 Spread a blanket on the sand 
 Three a.m. go for a swim 
 Clothes and all jump right in tonight 
 Startin' tonight 
 Let out the stops, call the cops 
 It's all right 
 'Course when the cops have come and gone 
 You'll just keep carrying on 
 Don't you worry if you land in jail 
 We'll forward your mail if you can't make bail 
 Tonight, startin' tonight 
 Have a ball do it all startin' tonight 
 Anything goes, everything goes 
 Startin' tonight 
 Startin' tonight
