Six foot six stood on the ground 
 Weighed 235 pounds 
 But I saw that giant of a man brought down 
 To his knees by love 
 He was the kind of man who would gamble on love 
 Look you in the eye and never back up 
 But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup 
 Because of love 
 Can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands 
 Like the rules that govern our land 
 Strong enough to rule the heart of every man 
 This thing called love 
 It can lift you up, it can put you down 
 Take your world and turn it all around 
 Ever since time nothing's ever been found 
 Stronger than love 
 Men like me they worry and doubt 
 Trouble their minds day in and day out 
 Too busy with your livin' to worry 
 About a thing called love 
 But then I see a mother's tenderness 
 As she holds her young close to her breast 
 Then I say thank God this world will win 
 With the thing called love 
 Can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands 
 Like the rules that govern our land 
 Strong enough to rule the heart of every man 
 This thing called love 
 It can lift you up, it can put you down 
 Take your world and turn it all around 
 Ever since time nothing's ever been found 
 Stronger than love
