(Spring fever, love is in the air) 
 A little bird, he told me so 
 He said, 
 "Come on, get on the go 
 Open your eyes the sky is full of butterflies." 
 The blossoms on the trees 
 Stir up the honey bees 
 Spring makes my fever right 
 (Spring fever) 
 (Spring fever) 
 , spring is here at last 
 (Spring fever) 
 my heart's beating fast 
 (There is no doubt now, love is in the air) 
 Get up, get out, spring is everywhere 
 Well if you feel the wanderlust 
 Just grab a car or hop a bus 
 In every town there's excitement to be found 
 So much is happening 
 Don't miss the joy of spring 
 The world's in love just look around 
 (Spring fever) 
 (Spring fever) 
 comes to everyone 
 (Spring fever) 
 it's time for fun 
 (There is no doubt now, love is in the air) 
 Get up, get out, spring is everywhere 
 Spring fever, it's spring fever time 
 Spring fever, watch that fever climb 
 (There is no doubt now love is in the air) 
 Get up, get out spring is everywhere 
 Spring is everywhere 
 (Ah)
