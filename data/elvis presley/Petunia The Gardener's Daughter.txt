I've gotta gal, oh what a pal 
 The apple of my eye 
 With something rare, a peach of a pear 
 But her dad won't let us meet and I could die 
 I love petunia the gardener's daughter 
 Ooh how that gal can kiss 
 Her eyes are blue as bluebells 
 Each cheek a rose to see 
 How I dance when she plants her two lips on me 
 I'm as daffy as a daffodil 
 I long to kiss her all the time 
 Tonight I'll steal into her garden 
 And make petunia's two lips mine 
 (I've got a beau, I love him so 
 The apple of my eye 
 With something rare, a peach of a pear 
 But my dad won't let us meet and I could die) 
 And we could die 
 I love petunia the gardener's daughter 
 Ooh how that gal can kiss 
 (My eyes are blue as bluebells 
 Each cheek a rose to see) 
 How I dance when she plants her two lips on me 
 (He's as daffy as a daffodil 
 He loves to kiss me all the time) 
 Tonight I'll steal into her garden 
 And make petunia's two lips mine 
 She makes other girls look just like weeds 
 (I'm gonna be his clinging vine) 
 Tonight I'll steal into her garden 
 And make petunia's two lips 
 (My ever loving two lips) 
 Make petunia's two lips mine
