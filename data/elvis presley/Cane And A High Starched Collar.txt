Cowboy, cowboy marry me 
 I'll bake you a cherry pie 
 Well thank you very kindly mam 
 But I'm too young to die 
 Hi-lo-do-si-dosy-do 
 Stay single and save a dollar 
 Come Saturday night I'll court a pretty girl 
 With a cane and a high starched collar 
 Cowboy if you'll marry me 
 I'll be your darling Jenny 
 Now why should I drink from just one well 
 When I can drink from twen'y 
 Hi-lo-do-si-dosy-do 
 Stay single and save a dollar 
 Come Saturday night I'll court a pretty girl 
 With a cane and a high starched collar 
 Cowboy, cowboy name the day 
 July'd be nice I reckon 
 Gladly meet you at the church 
 July the 32nd 
 Hi-lo-do-si-dosy-do 
 Stay single and save a dollar 
 Come Saturday night I'll court a pretty girl 
 With a cane and a high starched collar 
 You sleep all day and spoon all night 
 And eat your favorite chow 
 Then why should I get married mam 
 That's what I'm doing now 
 Hi-lo-do-si-dosy-do 
 Stay single and save a dollar 
 Come Saturday night I'll court a pretty girl 
 With a cane and a high starched collar
