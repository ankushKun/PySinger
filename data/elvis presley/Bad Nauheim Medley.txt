I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen (Thomas P. Westendorf) 
 I'll take you home again Kathleen 
 Across the ocean wild 
 To where your heart has ever been 
 Since first you were my bonny bride 
 The roses all have left your cheek 
 I watch them fade away and die 
 Your voice is soft when you speak 
 And tears bedim your lovely eyes 
 Oh, I will take you home Kathleen 
 Across the ocean wild 
 And when the fields are soft and green 
 I will take you you home Kathleen 
 I Will Be True (Ivory Joe Hunter) 
 Somehow I feel 
 That someday we'll meet again 
 Don't ask me how 
 It's something I can't explain 
 Until the day 
 I give up all hope of you 
 Assure yourself this I'll do 
 I will be true 
 It's Been So Long Darling (Ernest Tubb) 
 It's been so long darling 
 Since I gazed into your eyes 
 It's been so long darling 
 But now I realize 
 'Bout your love, not seeing you, 
 It hurts me through and through 
 It's been so long darling 
 Well, I'm coming back to you 
 Apron Strings (Weiss/Schroeder) 
 Tadadada ... 
 Tadadada 
 It's crazy I know 
 I don't wanna be tied to your Apron strings 
 I don't wanna be tied to your Apron strings 
 There's No Tomorrow (Hoffman - Corday - Carr) 
 There tatatatata 
 There's no tomorrow 
 When love isn't near
