Hearts made of stone will never break 
 'Cause your love is never there, they just don't care 
 You can ask and plea, please, please, please work 
 And all your love is there to stay 
 These hearts of stone will cause you pain 
 Although you love there has stopped just the same 
 You can ask and plea, please, please, please work 
 And all your love is there to stay 
 But they'll say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 You daddy know, I thought I knew hearts made of stone 
 Hearts made of stone will never break 
 'Cause your love is never there, they just don't care 
 You can ask and plea, please, please, please work 
 And all your love is there to stay 
 'Cause they'll say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 You daddy know, I thought I knew hearts made of stone
