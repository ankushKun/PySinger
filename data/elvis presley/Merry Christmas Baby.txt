Merry, merry Christmas baby 
 Sure did treat me nice 
 I said merry Christmas baby 
 Sure did treat me nice 
 Gave me a diamond ring for Christmas 
 Now I'm living in paradise 
 Well I'm feeling might fine 
 Got good music on my radio 
 Well, I'm feeling might fine 
 Got good music on my radio 
 Well, I want to kiss you baby 
 While you're standing beneath the mistletoe 
 I said, merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas baby 
 You sure did treat me nice 
 Yes, you did, yes, you did 
 Yes, you did, yes, you did 
 I said merry, merry Christmas baby 
 Sure did treat me nice 
 Gave me diamond ring for Christmas 
 Now I'm puttin' it through Al's mike
