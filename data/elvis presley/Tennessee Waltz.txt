I was dancin' with my darlin' to the Tennessee Waltz 
 When an old friend I happened to see 
 I introduced her to my loved one 
 And while they were dancin' 
 My friend stole my sweetheart from me. 
 I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz 
 Now I know just how much I have lost 
 Yes, I lost my little darlin' the night they were playing 
 The beautiful Tennessee Waltz.
