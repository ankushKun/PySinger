My Jesus knows when I am lonely 
 He knows each pain, he sees each care 
 He understands each lonely heartache 
 He understands because he cares 
 My Jesus knows just what I need 
 Oh yes! He knows just what I need 
 He satisfies and every need supplies 
 Yes, he knows just what I need 
 My Jesus knows just what I need 
 Oh yes! He knows just what I need 
 He satisfies and every need supplies 
 Yes, he knows just what I need
