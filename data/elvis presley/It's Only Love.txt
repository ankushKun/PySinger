I see the the sunlight in her hair 
 I feel the warm smile that she wears 
 She has no recipe for love 
 But I just can't get enough 
 From the distance of my mind 
 Clock that's ringing says it's time 
 Wake up to my destiny 
 It's time to face reality 
 It's only love that I feel inside 
 But I'll get by somehow 
 It's only love, there must be something else for me girl 
 I tell myself that it's not real 
 There's nothing left for me to feel 
 I'll just be going on my way 
 Tomorrow brings another day 
 Only love that I feel inside 
 But I've got to be strong 
 My mind's made up, it's only love 
 But I know I'll get by, take my heart and my pride 
 And just throw it aside 
 It's only love 
 It's only love, it's only love, it's only love 
 It's only love 
 It's only love
