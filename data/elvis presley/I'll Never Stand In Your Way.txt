If you found someone new who means more than me to you. 
 I'd never stand in your way 
 If you feel we must part, don't let pity rule your heart 
 I'll never stand in your way 
 I love you much too much to ever lose you 
 But what is to be will be and I'll obey 
 I'll be blue when you go but I'll never let it show. 
 I'd never stand in your way 
 I loved you much too much to ever lose you 
 But what is to be will be and I'll obey 
 I'll be blue when you go but I'll never let it show 
 I'd never stand in your way
