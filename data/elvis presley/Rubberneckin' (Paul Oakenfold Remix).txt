Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy 
 It's called rubberneckin' baby but that's all right with me 
 Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy 
 It's called rubberneckin' baby but that's all right with me 
 Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy 
 It's called rubberneckin' baby but that's all right with me 
 Some people say I'm wasting time, they don't really know 
 Like what I see I see what I like yeh, it gives me such a glow 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 The First thing in the morning, last thing at night 
 I look, stare everywhere and see everything inside 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy 
 It's called rubberneckin' baby but that's all right with me 
 People say I'm wasting time yeh, but I don't really care 
 I see what I like I like what I see yeh, it gives me such a glow 
 Ho, ho, ho 
 Sittin' on the back porch all by myself 
 Along came Mary Jane with somebody else 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy 
 It's called rubberneckin' baby, that's all right with me, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy 
 It's called rubberneckin' baby, that's all right with me, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, baby that's all right with me 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, rubberneckin' baby but that's all right with me 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, 
 Stop
