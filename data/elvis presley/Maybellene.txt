Maybellene, why can't you be true? 
 Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true? 
 You've started back doing the things you used to do. 
 As I was motivatin' over the hill 
 I saw Maybellene in a coup de ville. 
 A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road, 
 Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford. 
 The cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five, 
 She's bumper to bumber rollin' side by side. 
 Maybellene, why can't you be true? 
 Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true? 
 You've started back doing the things you used to do. 
 The cadillac moved to a hundred and four 
 Got hot and wouldn't do no more 
 It got cloudy and started to rain 
 Tooted my horn in the passing lane 
 The rain water blowin' all under my hood 
 I knew that was doin' my motor no good 
 Maybellene, why can't you be true? 
 Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true? 
 You've started back doing the things you used to do. 
 Maybellene, why can't you be true? 
 Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true? 
 You've started back doing the things you used to do. 
 The motor cooled down, the heat went down 
 And that's when I heard that highway sound. 
 The Cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead 
 A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead. 
 The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still 
 And I caught Mabellene at the top of the hill. 
 Maybellene, why can't you be true? 
 Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true? 
 You've started back doing the things you used to do. 
 You've started back doing the things you used to do.
