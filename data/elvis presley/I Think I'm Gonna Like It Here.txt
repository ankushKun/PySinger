No one's in a hurry, no one seems to worry 
 Why they're all so happy is very clear 
 Every day siesta, every night fiesta 
 I think I'm gonna like it here 
 All this lovely scenery, more to it than greenery 
 I know a chance for romance is always near 
 Mission bells are ringing, everybody's singing 
 I think I'm gonna like it hear 
 The sound of laughter from every doorway 
 Sweet music floating across the square 
 It seems to say things are going your way 
 Your troubles like bubbles will soon disappear in the air 
 Down to my last peso, but I'm not afraid to say so 
 I feel just like a brave Spanish cavalier 
 I don't care where we go, so lead on mi amigo 
 I think I'm gonna like it here 
 Melodias... lapieras 
 Your troubles like bubbles will soon disappear in the air 
 Down to my last peso, but I'm not afraid to say so 
 I feel just like a brave Spanish cavalier 
 I don't care where we go, so lead on mi amigo 
 I think I'm gonna like it here 
 I think I'm gonna like it here 
 I think I'm gonna like it here 
 I think I'm gonna like it here
