Build it up, knock it down 
 Hold it square, roll it around 
 Throw it in the air, stick it in the ground 
 But it's too bad, I can't get mad 
 'Cause I'm a roustabout 
 Tie it loose, make it tight 
 If it's wrong, do it right 
 Makes me kinda feel like I wanna fight 
 But it's too bad, I can't get mad 
 'Cause I'm a roustabout 
 Orders all day and half the night, from the boss 
 That guys cousin don't wanna see one minute lost 
 Stack it up, in the rig 
 Better still, bring it here 
 Wanna take it out stick it in his ear 
 But it's too bad, I can't get mad 
 'Cause I'm a roustabout 
 A handyman is all I am around this place 
 Every time I turn around he's right up in my face 
 Bring it in, drag it out 
 When I'm slow, boy he shouts 
 Gettin' aweful tired runnin' in and out 
 But it's too bad, I can't get mad 
 'Cause I'm a roustabout
