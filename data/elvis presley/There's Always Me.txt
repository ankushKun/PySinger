When the evening shadows fall, 
 And you're wond'ring who to call 
 For a little company 
 There's always me 
 If your great romance should end, 
 And you're lonesome for a friend 
 Darling, you need never be 
 There's always me 
 I don't seem to mind somehow 
 Playing second fiddle now 
 Someday you'll want me, dear, 
 And when that day is here, 
 Within my arms you'll come to know 
 Other loves may come and go 
 But my love for you will be eternally 
 Look around and you will see 
 There's always me.
