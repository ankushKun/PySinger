There's no joy in my heart, 
 Only sorrow 
 And I'm sad 
 As a man can be 
 I sit alone in the darkness 
 Of my lonely room 
 And this room 
 Is a prison to me 
 I look at window 
 And what to I see 
 I see a bird 
 Way up in the tree 
 I want to be free free 
 Free - ee - ee - ee 
 I want to be free 
 Like the bird in the tree 
 What good are my eyes, 
 They can't see you 
 And my arms, 
 They can't hold so tight 
 I have two lips 
 That are yearning, 
 But they're no good to me 
 'Cause I know I can't kiss you tonight 
 I look at window 
 And what to I see 
 I see a bird 
 Way up in the tree 
 I want to be free free 
 Free - ee - ee - ee 
 I want to be free 
 Like the bird in the tree 
 I want to be free 
 Like the bird in the tree
