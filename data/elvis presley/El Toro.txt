There's a legend of a famous matador 
 Who went to meet el toro 
 Though he fought as he had never done before 
 He could not beat el toro 
 The bull el toro 
 Brought him defeat and pain 
 And to his sorrow 
 The matador knew shame 
 They said time would never heal the many scars 
 Brought by the great el toro 
 And the bitterness that burned deep in his heart 
 Caused him to hate el toro 
 The bull el toro 
 Brought him defeat and pain 
 And to his sorrow 
 The matador knew shame 
 So one night when no one was on sight 
 The matador went to finish the score 
 In the lonely fields, beneath the pale moonlight 
 He fought the bull and they fought once more 
 When they found the matador and saw him dying 
 He'd never see tomorrow 
 Now they say that on the spot where he was lying 
 Still walks the proud el toro 
 The bull el toro 
 Brought him defeat and pain 
 And to his sorrow 
 The matador knew shame
