Well I've got a gal, she's as cute as she can be 
 She's a distant cousin but she's not too distant with me 
 We'll kiss all night, I'll squeeze her tight 
 But we're kissin' cousins that's what makes it all right 
 All right, all right, all right 
 Oh I've got a girl and she taught me how to live 
 She can give a lot and she's got a lot to give 
 We'll kiss all night, I'll squeeze her tight 
 But we're kissin' cousins an' that's what makes it all right 
 All right, all right, all right 
 Yes we're all cousins, that's what I believe 
 Because we're children of Adam and Eve 
 I got a girl and she wants a lot of love 
 That's the kind of trouble I need plenty of 
 We'll kiss all night, I'll squeeze her tight 
 But we'll be kissin' cousins an' that'll make it all right 
 All right, all right, all right 
 But we'll be kissin' cousins that'll make it all right 
 All right, all right, all right 
 Yeah we're all cousins, that's what I believe 
 Because we're all children of Adam and Eve 
 I got a girl and she wants a lot of love 
 That's the kind of trouble I need plenty of 
 We'll kiss all night, I'll squeeze her tight 
 And we'll be kissin' cousins an' that'll make it all right 
 All right, all right, all right 
 We'll be kissin' cousins that'll make it all right 
 All right, all right, all right
