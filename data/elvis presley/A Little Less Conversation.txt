Hey! 
 A little less conversation, a little more action 
 All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me 
 A little more bite, a little less bark 
 A little less fight and a little more spark 
 Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me 
 Satisfy me baby 
 Baby close your eyes and listen to the music 
 Dig to the summer breeze 
 It's a groovy night and I can show you how to use it 
 Come along with me and put your mind at ease hey 
 A little less conversation, a little more action please 
 All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me 
 A little more bite, a little less bark 
 A little less fight and a little more spark 
 Shut your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me 
 Satisfy me baby 
 Come on baby, I'm tired of talking 
 Grab your coat and let's start walking 
 Come on, come on 
 Come on, come on 
 Come on, come on 
 Don't procrastinate 
 Don't articulate 
 Girl it's getting late 
 You just sit and wait around 
 Yeah, a little less conversation, a little more action 
 All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me 
 A little more bite, a little less bark 
 A little less fight and a little more spark 
 Shut your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me 
 Satisfy me baby
