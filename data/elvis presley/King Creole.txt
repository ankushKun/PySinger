There's a man in New Orleans 
 Who plays rock and roll 
 He's a guitar man 
 With a great big soul 
 He lays down a beat 
 Like a ton of coal 
 He goes by the name of King Creole 
 You know he's gone, gone, gone 
 Jumpin' like a catfish on a pole 
 You know he's gone, gone, gone 
 Hip shaking King Creole 
 When the king starts to do it 
 It's as good as done 
 He holds his guitar 
 Like a tommy gun 
 He starts to growl 
 From way down his throat 
 He bends a string 
 And "that's all she wrote" 
 Well, he sings a song about a crawdad hole 
 He sings a song about a jelly roll 
 He sings a song about pork and greens 
 He sings some blues about New Orleans 
 Well, he plays something evil 
 Then he plays something sweet 
 No matter how he plays 
 You got to get up on your feet 
 When he gets the rockin' fever 
 Baby, heaven sakes 
 He don't stop playin' 
 Till his guitar breaks
