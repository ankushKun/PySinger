Well, he's so high 
 (so high you can't get over him) 
 So wide 
 (so wide you can't get around him) 
 So low 
 (so low you can't get under him) 
 Great God almighty 
 (you must come in at the door) 
 Oh well, he's high ( 
 so high you can't get over him) 
 He's wide 
 (so wide you can't get around him) 
 So low 
 (so low you can't get under him) 
 The mighty lamb 
 (you must come in at the door) 
 Well I went down in the valley 
 You know I did over there ever stay 
 My soul got happy in the valley 
 You know I stayed right there all day 
 It's high 
 (so high you can't get over him) 
 And he's wide 
 (so wide you can't get around him) 
 I know it's so low 
 (so low you can't get under him) 
 The mighty lamb 
 (you must come in at the door) 
 Well I ain't been to heaven 
 But I'm, I'm told 
 The streets the streets are pearls 
 You know the mighty mighty mighty gates are gold 
 And he's high 
 (so high you can't get over him) 
 So wide 
 (so wide you can't get around him) 
 He's so low 
 (so low you can't get under him) 
 The mighty lamb 
 (you must come in at the door) 
 Well, he's high (so high you can't get over him) 
 And he's wide (so wide you can't get around him) 
 I know he's so low (so low you can't get under him) 
 The mighty lamb (you must come in at the door)
