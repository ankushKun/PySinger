Seven lonely days and a dozen towns ago 
 I reached out one night and you were gone 
 Don't know why you'd run, what you're running to or from 
 All I know is I want to bring you home 
 So I'm walking in the rain, thumbing for a ride 
 On this lonely Kentucky back road 
 I've loved you much too long, my love's too strong 
 To let you go, never knowing what went wrong 
 Kentucky rain keeps pouring down 
 And up ahead's another town that I'll go walking through 
 With the rain in my shoes (Rain in my shoes) 
 Searching for you 
 In the cold Kentucky rain 
 In the cold Kentucky rain 
 Showed your photograph to some old gray-bearded men 
 Sitting on a bench outside a general store 
 They said, "Yes, she's been here" 
 But their memory wasn't clear 
 Was it yesterday? 
 No, wait, the day before 
 Finally got a ride with a preacher man who asked 
 "Where you bound on such a cold dark afternoon?" 
 As we drove on through the rain, as he listened, I explained 
 And he left me with a prayer that I'd find you 
 Kentucky rain keeps pouring down 
 And up ahead's another town that I'll go walking through 
 With the rain in my shoes (Rain in my shoes) 
 Searching for you 
 In the cold Kentucky rain 
 In the cold Kentucky rain 
 In the cold Kentucky rain 
 In the cold Kentucky rain 
 In the cold Kentucky rain 
 In the cold Kentucky rain 
 In the cold Kentucky rain
