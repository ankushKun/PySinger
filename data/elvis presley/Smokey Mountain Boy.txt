I'm just a Smokey Mountain boy 
 Comin' back to the hills I love 
 Where the tops of pine all bend in the wind 
 And the deep blue sky above 
 The closer and closer I get to home 
 The more excited I am 
 Those were the mornings I'd roll out of bed 
 Start the day off with a hot corn bread 
 Smothered in huckleberry jam 
 I'm just a Smokey Mountain boy 
 Comin' back to the hills I love 
 Where the tops of pine all bend in the wind 
 And the deep blue sky above 
 I can almost hear the hounds running through the woods 
 Close on the trail of a hare 
 How I long to be with them 
 Following the hounds a-huntin' again 
 Gettin' me a big old grizzly bear 
 I'm just a Smokey Mountain boy 
 Comin' back to the hills I love 
 Where the tops of pine all bend in the wind 
 And the deep blue sky above 
 I've traveled around and met lots of girls 
 No matter how many I see 
 I left some pretty ones behind 
 I know back home is where I'll find 
 The girl whose love is meant for me 
 I'm just a Smokey Mountain boy 
 Comin' back to the hills I love 
 Where the tops of pine all bend in the wind 
 And the deep blue sky above
