My name should be trouble 
 My name should be woe 
 For trouble and heartache 
 Is all that I know 
 But danny, yes, danny is my name 
 My life has been empty 
 My heart has been torn 
 It must have been rainy, oh yeah, 
 The night I was born 
 Oh danny, oh danny is my name 
 I'm so afraid of tomorrow 
 So tired of today 
 They say that love is the answer 
 But love never came my way 
 I'm writing a letter 
 To someone I know 
 So if you should find it 
 And if you're alone 
 Oh danny, yes, danny is my name 
 Oh danny, yes, danny is my name 
 Oh-oh-oh-oh
