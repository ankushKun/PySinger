Rock-a-hula, Rock-Rock-a-hula 
 Rock-a-hula, Rock-Rock-a-hula 
 Rock-a-hula, Rock-Rock-a-hula 
 Rock-a-hula, Rock-Rock-a-hula 
 Rock-a-hula, Rock-Rock-a-hula 
 Rock-a-hula, Rock 
 The way she moves her hips to her fingertips 
 I feel I'm heaven bound 
 And when she starts to sway, I've gotta say 
 She really move the grass around 
 Rock-a-hula baby 
 Rock-a-hula baby 
 Got a hula lulu from Honolulu 
 That rock-a-hula baby of mine 
 Rock-a-hula, Rock-Rock-a-hula 
 Rock-a-hula, Rock 
 Although I love to kiss my little hula miss 
 I never get the chance 
 I wanna hold her tight all through the night 
 But all she wants to do is dance 
 Rock-a-hula baby 
 Rock-a-hula baby 
 Got a hula lulu from Honolulu 
 That rock-a-hula baby of mine 
 Rock-a-hula baby 
 Rock-a-hula baby 
 Got a hula lulu from Honolulu 
 That rock-a-hula baby of mine 
 Rock-a-hula baby of mine
