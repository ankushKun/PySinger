Some of you all never been down South too much 
 I'm gonna tell you a little story, 
 So you'll understand where I'm talking about 
 Down there we have a plant that 
 Grows out in the woods and the fields 
 And it looks something like a turnip green 
 Everybody calls it Polk salad 
 Now that's Polk salad 
 Used to know a girl that lived down there and 
 She'd go out in the evenings to pick a mess of it 
 Carry it home and cook it for supper 
 'Cause that's about all they had to eat 
 But they did all right 
 Down in Louisiana 
 Where the alligators grow so mean 
 Lived a girl that I swear to the world 
 Made the alligators look tame 
 Polk salad Annie 
 'Gators got your granny 
 Everybody said it was a shame 
 For the mama was working on the chain gang 
 What a mean, vicious woman 
 Everyday before suppertime 
 She'd go down by the truck patch 
 And pick her a mess of polk salad 
 And carry it home in a tote sack 
 Polk salad Annie 
 'Gators got you granny 
 Everybody said it was a shame 
 'Cause the mama was working on the chain gang 
 (Whoo) 
 How wretched, spiteful 
 Straight-razor totin' woman 
 Lord have mercy 
 Sock a little polk salad to me 
 Yeah, you know what, yeah, yeah 
 But daddy was a lazy and a no count 
 Claimed he had a bad back 
 All her brothers were fit for 
 Was stealing watermelons out of my truck patch 
 Polk salad Annie 
 'Gators got your granny 
 Everybody said it was a shame 
 Because mama was working on the chain gang 
 Sock a little polk salad to me 
 You know what makes a meal mention 
 You sock a little 
 Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah 
 Chic a bon, chic a bon 
 Chic a bon bon bon bon 
 Chic a bon, chic a bon 
 Chic a bon bon bon bon 
 Sock a little Polk salad to me 
 You know what makes a meal mention 
 Sock a little Polk salad to him 
 You know what meets a meal mention 
 Chinc, chinc, chinc, 
 Chin, ling, ling ling
