Some like their women short 
 Some like 'em tall 
 I'll take them any size 
 'Cause I love them all 
 I'm just wild about smorgasbord 
 I got a cravin' for smorgasbord 
 A little kiss here, a little kiss there 
 That's smorgasbord 
 Some take just apple pie 
 Some take just cake 
 I'll take the dish I please 
 Please the dish I take 
 I'm just wild about smorgasbord 
 I got a cravin' for smorgasbord 
 A little kiss here, a little kiss there 
 That's smorgasbord 
 Mmm, ah 
 Some like just southern belles 
 They got a one track mind 
 I go for all the bells 
 Except the wedding kind 
 I'm just wild about smorgasbord 
 I got a cravin' for smorgasbord 
 A little kiss here, a little kiss there 
 That's smorgasbord 
 Some like their women short 
 Some like 'em tall 
 I'll take 'em any size 
 'Cause I love them all, mmm 
 Some take just apple pie 
 Some take just cake
