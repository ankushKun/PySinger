You're not a dream, 
 You're not an angel, 
 You're a woman, 
 I'm not a king, 
 I'm just a man, 
 Take my hand, 
 We'll make a space, 
 In this life that we planned, 
 And here we'll stay, 
 Until it's time for you to go. 
 Yes, we're diff'rent, worlds apart, 
 We're not the same, 
 We laughed and played, 
 At the start, like in a game, 
 You could have stayed, 
 Outside my heart, 
 But in you came, 
 And here you'll stay, 
 Until it's time for you to go. 
 Don't ask why, 
 Don't ask how, 
 Don't ask forever, 
 Love me, love me, 
 Love me, love me now. 
 This love of mine, 
 Had no beginning, 
 It has no end, 
 I was an oak, 
 Now I'm a willow, 
 Now I can bend, 
 And tho' I'll never, 
 In my life see you again, 
 And still I'll stay, 
 Until it's time for you to go. 
 Don't ask why, 
 Don't ask how, 
 Don't ask forever, 
 Love me, love me, 
 Love me, love me now. 
 This love of mine, 
 Had no beginning, 
 It has no end, 
 I was an oak, 
 Now I'm a willow, 
 And I can bend, 
 And tho' I'll never, 
 In my life see you again, 
 Here I'll stay, 
 Until it's time for you to go, 
 Yes I'll stay, 
 Until it's time for you to go.
