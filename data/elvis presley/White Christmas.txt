I'm dreaming of a white christmas, 
 Just like the ones I used to know. 
 Where those tree-tops glisten, 
 And children listen 
 To hear sleighbells in the snow. 
 I'm dreaming of a white christmas, 
 With every christmas card I write, 
 May your days be merry and bright, 
 And may all your christmases be white. 
 I'm dreaming of a white christmas, 
 Just like the ones I used to know. 
 May your days may your days may your days be merry and bright, 
 And may all your christmases be white.
