I want a barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad 
 Won't you play for me a down home country song 
 'Cause when I kick my shoes off and I kick my blues off 
 With a barefoot ballad you just can't go wrong 
 Give me a honk-tonk fiddle with a guitar in the middle of a melody 
 Humming like a fountain swinging out on Smokey Mountain 
 Barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad 
 Won't you play for me a down home country song 
 'Cause when I kick my shoes off and I kick my blues off 
 With a barefoot ballad you just can't go wrong 
 Now the big toe's connected to the two toe 
 And the two toe's connected to the three toe 
 And the three toe's connected to the four toe 
 And the four toe's connected to the five toe 
 And the five toe 
 (that's a live toe) 
 and away we go 
 I want a barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad 
 Won't you play for me a down home country song 
 'Cause when I kick my shoes off and I kick my blues off 
 With a barefoot ballad you just can't go wrong 
 Now the big toe's connected to the two toe 
 And the two toe's connected to the three toe 
 And the three toe's connected to the four toe 
 And the four toe's connected to the five toe 
 And the five toe 
 (that's a live toe) 
 and away we go 
 I wanna barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad 
 Won't you play for me 
 (play for who?) 
 (Play for him) 
 (Play for her) 
 A barefoot ballad song
