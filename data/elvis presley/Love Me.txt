Treat me like a fool 
 Treat me mean and cruel 
 But love me 
 Break my faithful heart 
 Tear it all apart 
 But love me 
 If you ever go 
 Darling, I'll be oh, oh so lonely 
 I'll be sad and blue 
 Crying over you, dear only 
 I would beg and steal 
 Just to feel your heart 
 Beatin' close to mine 
 Well, if you ever go 
 Darling, I'll be oh so lonely 
 I'll be sad and blue 
 Crying over you, dear only 
 I would beg and steal 
 Just to feel your heart 
 Beatin' close to mine 
 Well, if you ever go 
 Darling, I'll be oh so lonely 
 Beggin' on my knees 
 All I ask is please, please love me 
 Oh yeah
