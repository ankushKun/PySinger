See them tumbling down 
 Pledging their love to the ground 
 Lonely but free I'll be found 
 Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds 
 Cares of the past are behind 
 No where to go, but I'll find 
 Just where the trail will wind 
 Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds 
 I know when night has gone 
 That a new world born at dawn 
 I抣l keep rolling along 
 Deep in my heart is a song 
 Here on the range I belong 
 Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds 
 I know when night has gone 
 That a new world born at dawn 
 I'll keep rolling along 
 Deep in my heart is a song 
 Here on the range I belong 
 Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
