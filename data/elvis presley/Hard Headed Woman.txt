Well a hard headed woman, 
 A soft hearted man 
 Been the cause of trouble 
 Ever since the world began. 
 Oh yeah, ever since the world began 
 A hard headed woman been 
 A thorn in the side of man. 
 Now Adam told Eve, 
 Listen here to me, 
 Don't you let me catch you 
 Messin' round that apple tree. 
 Oh yeah, ever since the world began 
 A hard headed woman been 
 A thorn in the side of man. 
 Now Samson told Delilah 
 Loud and clear, 
 Keep your cotton pickin' fingers 
 Out my curly hair. 
 Oh yeah, ever since the world began 
 A hard headed woman been 
 A thorn in the side of man. 
 I heard about a king 
 Who was doin' swell 
 Till he started playing 
 With that evil Jezebel. 
 Oh yeah, ever since the world began 
 A hard headed woman been a thorn in the side of man. 
 I got a woman, 
 A head like a rock. 
 If she ever went away 
 I'd cry around the clock. 
 Oh yeah, ever since the world began 
 A hard headed woman been 
 A thorn in the side of man.
