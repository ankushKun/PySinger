I thank the Lord for everything 
 When things are going my way 
 He said to me, 'I will comfort thee' 
 'And drive your cares away' 
 He promised me, 'I will walk with thee' 
 'And drive your cares away' 
 I did not ask for riches 
 He gave me wealth untold 
 The moon, the stars, the sun, the sky 
 Are there for you to behold 
 I thank the Lord for everything 
 And I count my blessings each day 
 He came to me when I needed Him 
 I only have to pray 
 And He'll come to you - if you ask Him to 
 He's only a prayer away
