She loves me, she loves me not 
 She loves me, she loves me not 
 She loves me, she loves me, she loves me 
 The lady loves me and it shows 
 In spite of the way she turns up her nose 
 I'm her ideal, her hearts desire 
 Under that ice she's burning like fire 
 She'd like to cuddle up to me 
 She's playing hard to get 
 The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet 
 The gentleman has savoir-faire 
 As much as an elephant or a bear 
 I'd like to take him for a spin 
 Back to the zoo to visit his kin 
 He's got about as much appeal as a soggy cigarette 
 The lady loathes him but he doesn't know it yet 
 The lady's got a crush on me 
 The gentleman's crazy obviously 
 The lady's dying to be kissed 
 The gentleman needs a psychiatrist 
 I'd rather kiss a rattlesnake 
 Or play Russian roulette 
 The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet 
 She's falling fast she's on the skids 
 Both of his heads are flipping their lids 
 Tonight she'll hold me in her arms 
 I'd rather be holding hydrogen bombs 
 Will someone tell this Romeo 
 I'm not his Juliet 
 The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet 
 She wants me 
 Like poison ivy 
 Needs me 
 Like a hole in the head 
 Everyone can see she's got it bad 
 He's mad! 
 The gentleman is an egotist 
 I'm simply aware I'm hard to resist 
 He's one man I could learn to hate 
 How's about having dinner at eight 
 I'd rather dine with Frankenstein 
 In a moonlight tete-a-tete 
 The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet 
 Oh yes she loves me 
 Dig that shrinking violet 
 Oh she really loves me 
 Here's one gal you'll never get 
 She lo- lo- loves me 
 Would you like to make a bet 
 I said the lady loves me 
 The gentleman's all wet
