I see a change is coming to our lives 
 It's not the same as it used to be 
 And it's not too late to realize our mistake 
 We're just not right for each other 
 Love has slipped away left us only friends 
 We almost seem like strangers 
 All that's left between us are the memories we shared 
 Of times we thought we cared for each other 
 There's nothing left to do but go our separate ways 
 And pick up all the pieces left behind us 
 And maybe someday, somewhere along the way 
 Another love will find us 
 Some day when she's older 
 Maybe she will understand 
 Why her mom and dad are not together 
 The tears that she will cry when 
 I have to say goodbye 
 Will tear at my heart forever 
 There's nothing left to do but go our separate ways 
 And pick up all the pieces left behind us 
 And maybe someday, somewhere along the way 
 Another love will find us 
 Oh, oh, oh
