Easy come, easy go 
 Here, there, everywhere 
 Crazy love is in the air 
 Nightfall, Mmm, day and nightfall 
 So many girls in every port 
 You gotta be a juggernaut 
 Full speed ahead or you'll be caught 
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! 
 Easy come, easy go 
 Up, down, all around, kiss and kiss 
 And pound for pound, delicious 
 Mmm, so nutritious 
 Sailor beware take it slow 
 Easy come, easy go 
 Alright, uh huh 
 When you want love to keep you warm 
 There's nothing like a uniform 
 You got a port in any storm 
 Thar she blows 
 Easy come, easy go 
 Up, down, all around 
 Kiss and kiss and pound for pound 
 Delicious 
 Mmm, so nutritious 
 Sailor beware take it slow 
 Easy come, easy go 
 Sailor beware take it slow 
 Easy come, easy go, alright
