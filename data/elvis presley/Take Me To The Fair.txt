Take me to the fair 
 Take me to the fair, don't know anywhere 
 I would rather be 
 Let's, go to the fair 
 We'll walk hand in hand, through Tomorrow Land 
 Only you and me 
 I wanna see everything, do everything 
 While we're doin' it all 
 I'll buy the peanuts and popcorn 
 We'll have us a ball 
 You can spend my pay 
 Crush me in the crowds, I'll be in the clouds 
 Honey I don't care 
 Take me there by sleigh 
 Go, let's get a bite, anywhere you like 
 But take me to the fair 
 I wanna see everything, do everything 
 While we're doin' it all 
 I'll buy the peanuts and popcorn 
 We'll have us a ball 
 Take me there by sleigh 
 Go, let's have a bite, anywhere you like 
 But take me to the fair 
 Take me to the fair, Take me to the fair 
 Take me to the fair
