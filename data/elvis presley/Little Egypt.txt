I went and bought myself a ticket and I sat down in the very first row 
 They pulled the curtain but then when they turned the spotlight way down low 
 Little egypt came out a-struttin' wearin' nothin' but a button and a bow 
 Singing, ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying 
 She had a ruby on her tummy and a diamond big as Texas on her toe 
 She let her hair down and she did the hoochie-coochie real slow 
 When she did her special number on the zebra skin I thought she'd stop the show 
 Singing, ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying 
 She did her triple somersault and when she hit the ground 
 She winked at the audience and then she turned around 
 She had a picture of a cowboy tatooed on her spine 
 Said, Phoenix, Arizona 1949 
 Yeah, let me tell you people little egypt doesn't dance there anymore 
 She's too busy mopping and a-takin' care of shopping at the store 
 'Cause we've got seven kids and all day long they crawl around the floor 
 Singing ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying
