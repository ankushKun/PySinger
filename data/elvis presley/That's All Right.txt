Well, that's all right, mama 
 That's all right with you 
 That's all right, mama, just anyway you do 
 Well, that's all right, that's all right 
 That's all right now, mama, anyway you do 
 Well, Mama, she done told me 
 Papa done told me too 
 Son, that gal your foolin' with 
 She ain't no good for you 
 But that's all right, that's all right 
 That's all right now, mama, anyway you do 
 I'm leaving town, baby 
 I'm leaving town for sure 
 Well, then you won't be bothered 
 With me hanging 'round your door 
 Well, that's all right, that's all right 
 That's all right now, mama, anyway you do 
 Ah da-da dee dee dee-dee 
 Dee dee dee-dee, dee dee dee-dee 
 I need your lovin', that's all right 
 That's all right now, mama, anyway you do
