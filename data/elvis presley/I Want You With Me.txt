When I was little, my mama said to me 
 One day you'll find a love to last eternally 
 I want you with me everywhere I go 
 So please don't leave me baby, I love you so 
 I'll be the ruler of this whole wide world 
 If you will only say you'll be my girl 
 I want you with me in everything I do 
 You know I need you baby, I'm in love with you 
 There is no mountain that I can't climb 
 You find the mountain, child, and I'll find the time 
 I want you with me, with me night and day 
 Well, you can make me happy baby, don't you go away 
 I'll swim an ocean with a raging foam 
 If I know that you'll be there when I come back home 
 I want you with me, you know I love you so 
 Well, I want you with me baby, I'll never let you go 
 Well, I want you with me baby, I'll never let you go
