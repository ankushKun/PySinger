Baby it's wrong, wrong as can be 
 To try and tie guy like me 
 I could never settle down in a little sleepy town 
 There's so much world to see 
 Sure we'd be happy for a while 
 But then we'd have to part 
 When tears replace your loving smile 
 Well, I don't want to be the guy who has to break your heart 
 So here's where it ends, not lovers but friends 
 Though your lips are tempting me 
 Maybe I'm a fool and yet this wanderer just can't forget 
 There's so much world to see 
 Sure we'd be happy for a while 
 But then we'd have to part 
 When tears replace your loving smile 
 Well I don't want to be the guy who has to break your heart 
 So here's where it ends, not lovers but friends 
 Though your lips are tempting me 
 Maybe I'm a fool and yet this wanderer just can't forget 
 There's so much world to see for me 
 There's so much world to see, yeah, yeah, mmm
