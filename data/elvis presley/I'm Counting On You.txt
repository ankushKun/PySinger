All the words that I'll ever know 
 Still could not say 
 How much I need you so 
 In every way 
 I go roam and you guide me 
 And only you can do 
 Hold my hand, stand beside me 
 I'm counting on you 
 I'm counting on you, dear 
 From the dawn of each day 
 To always come through, dear 
 In your kind, lovin' way 
 If you'd knew just how deeply 
 I feel things you do 
 Then you'd know how completely 
 I'm counting on you 
 I'm counting on you, dear 
 From the dawn of each day 
 To always come through, dear 
 In your kind, lovin' way 
 If you'd knew just how deeply 
 I feel things you do 
 Then you'd know how completely 
 I'm counting on you
