Well lawdy, lawdy, lawdy Miss Clawdy 
 Girl You sure look good to me 
 Well please don't excite me baby 
 I know it can't be me 
 Because I give you all of my money 
 Yeah, but you just won't treat me right 
 You like to ball every morning 
 Don't come home till late at night 
 I'm gonna tell, tell my momma 
 Lord I swear to God what you been doing to me 
 I'm gonna tell everybody 
 That I'm down in misery 
 So bye, bye bye baby 
 Girl I won't be coming no more 
 Goodbye little darling 
 Down the road I go
