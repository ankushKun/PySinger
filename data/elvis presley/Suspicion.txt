Ev'rytime you kiss me 
 I'm still not certain that you love me 
 Ev'ry time you hold me 
 I'm still not certain that you care 
 Though you keep on saying 
 You really, really, really love me 
 Do you speak the same words 
 To someone else when I'm not there 
 Suspicion torments my heart 
 Suspicion keeps us apart 
 Suspicion why torture me 
 Ev'rytime you call me 
 And tell me we should meet tomorrow 
 I can't help but think that 
 You're meeting someone else tonight 
 Why should our romance just 
 Keep on causing me such sorrow? 
 Why am I so doubtful 
 Whenever you're out of sight? 
 Darling, if you love me, 
 I beg you wait a little longer 
 Wait until I drive all 
 These foolish fears out of my mind 
 How I hope and pray that 
 Our love will keep on growing stronger 
 Maybe I'm suspicious 
 'Cause true love is so hard to find
