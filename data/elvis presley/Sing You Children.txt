Oh Jonah he was desperate 
 In the belly of the whale 
 Well jonah had a plan 
 He knew he couldn't fail 
 He raised his head on high 
 And looking for the sky 
 And he sang his song so pretty 
 The whale told him goodbye 
 You got to sing you children sing 
 Sing you children sing 
 I only know one thing, hey! hey! hey! 
 Sing you children sing, everybody 
 Sing you children sing 
 Sing your troubles away 
 Well, Moses said good lord 
 Open up these waters for me 
 So I can get your chidren 
 Across the salty sea 
 Well the Lord parted the waters 
 And singing hand in hand 
 Moses and the children 
 Walked over to the promised land 
 You got to sing you children sing 
 Sing you children sing 
 (Hallelujah) 
 I only know one thing, hey! hey! hey! 
 Sing you children sing, everybody 
 Sing you children sing 
 (Hallelujah) 
 Sing your troubles away 
 Oh Joshua had a plan 
 At the walls of Jericho 
 He'd march around those walls 
 And on his horn he'd blow 
 That horn would play a tune 
 And sing a happy song 
 When Joshua got through 
 Those walls came tumbling down 
 You got to sing you children sing 
 Sing you children sing 
 (Hallelujah) 
 I only know one thing, hey! hey! hey! 
 Sing you children sing, everybody 
 Sing you children sing 
 (Hallelujah) 
 Sing your troubles away 
 You got to sing your troubles away 
 Sing your troubles away 
 You've got to sing your troubles away 
 Sing your troubles away 
 Sing your troubles away
