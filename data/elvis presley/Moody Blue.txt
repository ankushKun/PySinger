Well, it's hard to be a gambler 
 Bettin' on the number 
 That changes ev'ry time 
 Well, you think you're gonna win 
 Think she's givin' in 
 A stranger's all you find 
 Yeah, it's hard to figure out 
 What she's all about 
 But she's woman through and through 
 She's a complicated lady 
 So color my baby moody blue 
 Oh, Moody blue 
 Tell me am I gettin' through 
 I keep hangin' on, try to learn the song 
 But I never do 
 Oh, Moody blue 
 Tell me who I'm talkin' to 
 You're like the night and day and it's hard to say 
 Which one is you 
 Well, when Monday comes she's Tuesday 
 When Tuesday comes she's Wednesday 
 Into another day again 
 Her personality unwinds 
 Just like a ball of twine 
 On a spool that never ends 
 Just when I think I know her well 
 Her emotions reveal 
 She's not the person that I though I knew 
 She's a complicated lady 
 So color my baby moody blue 
 Oh, Moody blue 
 Tell me am I gettin' through 
 I keep hangin' on, try to learn the song 
 But I never do 
 Oh, Moody blue 
 Tell me who I'm talkin' to 
 You're like the night and day and it's hard to say 
 Which one is you 
 I'm afraid of my Moody blue 
 Oh, Moody blue 
 Tell me who I'm talkin' to 
 You're like the night and day and it's hard to say 
 Which one is you 
 Yeah, Moody blue 
 Tell me am I gettin' through 
 I keep hangin' on, try to learn the song 
 But I never do 
 Let me tell you 'bout Moody blue
