When her motor's warm and she's purrin' sweet 
 Buddy let me warn ya', you're on a one-way street 
 She'll crowd ya' close, spin your wheels 
 Then you're gonna know how it feels 
 To spinout, yeah, spinout 
 Better watch those curves, never let her steer 
 If she can shake your nerves, boy, then she can strip your gears 
 She'll get your heart goin' fast 
 Then she'll let you run out of gas 
 So spinout, spinout 
 The road to love is full of 
 Danger signs 
 Too many guys were lost 
 Who crossed those double lines 
 Don'tcha know she's out to prove, she can really score 
 Never saw parts move, boy, like that before 
 To flag you down, that's her goal 
 Scoot before you lose control 
 And spinout, yeah, spinout 
 The road to love is full of 
 Danger signs 
 Too many guys were lost 
 Who crossed those double lines 
 Don'tcha know she's out to prove, she can really score 
 Never saw parts move, boy, like that before 
 To flag you down, that's her goal 
 Scoot before you lose control 
 And spinout, yeah, spinout, spinout, all right
