I'm riding the rainbow, hitting the highway to happiness 
 Oh yes, I'm looking to find someone whose meant to be mine 
 I'm living to love 
 And loving to live 
 I've got a heart 
 I'm longing to give 
 I'm riding the rainbow, I'll follow that star to where you are 
 I'm riding the rainbow, heading for heaven and happiness 
 I guess somebody somewhere, someday will teach me to care 
 But being alone, 
 Don't bother me 
 I'm free to have fun 
 It's fun to be free 
 I'm riding the rainbow, I'll follow that star 
 I'm riding the rainbow to where you are
