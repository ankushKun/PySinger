There's a long line of mourners 
 Driving down our little street 
 Their fancy cars are such a sight to see, oh yea 
 They're all rich friends who knew you in the scene 
 And now they've finally brought you 
 Brought you home to me 
 When you left you know you told me 
 That some day you'd be returnin' 
 In a fancy car, all the town to see, oh yea, 
 Well now everyone is watching you 
 You finally had your dream, yea 
 You're ridin' in a long black limousine 
 You know the papers told of how you lost your life, oh yea 
 The party, the party and the fatal crash that night 
 Well the race along the highway, oh the curve you didn't see 
 When you're riding in that long black limousine 
 Through tear filled eyes I watch as you pass by oh yea 
 A chauffeur, a chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine 
 Well I never, I never, never, never 
 Oh my heart, all my dreams yea, they're with you 
 In that long black limousine
