It's a sin, my darling 
 How I love you 
 Because I know 
 Our love could never be 
 It's a sin 
 To keep this memory of you 
 When silence proves 
 That you've forgotten me 
 The dreams I built for us 
 Has tumbled 
 Each promise broken 
 Like my heart 
 It's a sin, my darling 
 How I love you 
 So much in love 
 And yet so far apart 
 I'm sure you're happy with another 
 Who shares the love I cannot win 
 Why pretend that I can live without you 
 When deep inside I know that it's a sin
