It's the feeling that I get holding my brand new baby 
 Holding on to daddy's thumb just as tightly as he can hold 
 And it's hearin' people say he looks a lot like his daddy 
 These things are a poor man's gold 
 It's the twinkle in the eyes of the gray haired old man we call grandpa 
 Tellin' tales to the kids that get taller every time there told 
 And it's knowin' that for a while he's no longer lonely 
 These things are a poor man's gold 
 It's the smell of honeysuckle in the springtime it's the silence of a freshly fallin' snow 
 It's the sound of children laughing in the sunshine 
 It's a crisp autum night with a million stars all aglow 
 And it's the sweet sleepy sound of your warm gentle breathing 
 As you cling to me in the night to keep away the cold 
 And it's the softness of your body there in the darkness 
 These things are a poor man's gold 
 Honey theses precious things are a poor man's gold
