Who are you, who am I? 
 Are we more than strangers passing by? 
 Is this your dream are you in mine? 
 Are we really here or lost in time? 
 Will you be friend or lover 
 Show me the heart you conceal 
 Now is the time to discover 
 If this feeling we're feeling is real 
 So close to love and yet so far 
 Just one kiss will tell us who we are 
 Will you be friend or lover 
 Show me the heart you conceal 
 Now is the time to discover 
 If this feeling we're feeling is real 
 So close to love and yet so far 
 Just one kiss will tell us who we are
