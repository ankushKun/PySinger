There must be lights burning brighter somewhere 
 Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue 
 If I can dream of a better land 
 Where all my brothers walk hand in hand 
 Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true 
 Oh, why 
 There must be peace and understanding sometime 
 Strong winds of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear 
 If I can dream of a warmer sun 
 Where hope keeps shining on everyone 
 Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear 
 We're lost in a cloud with too much rain 
 We're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain 
 But as long as a man has the strength to dream 
 He can redeem his soul and fly 
 Deep in my heart there's a trembling question 
 Still I am sure that the answer, answer's gonna come somehow 
 Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle, yeah 
 And while I can think, while I can talk 
 While I can stand, while I can walk 
 While I can dream, please let my dream come true, oh 
 Right now, let it come true right now 
 Oh yeah
