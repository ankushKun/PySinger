Show me Thy ways, O Lord 
 Show me Thy ways, O Lord 
 Help me love when I'm hated 
 Spread joy unabated 
 Show me Thy ways, O Lord 
 Jesus was more than just a man from Galilee 
 Christ, the son of God, he died for you and me 
 They discouraged him and walked him upon in delight 
 Still Jesus loved them, forgave and He cried 
 Show me Thy ways, O Lord 
 Show me Thy ways, O Lord 
 Help me love when I'm hated 
 Spread joy unabated 
 Show me Thy ways, O Lord 
 Show me Thy ways, O Lord 
 Help me love when I'm hated 
 Spread joy unabated 
 Show me Thy ways, O Lord
