I'd been standing on the corner 
 Since a quarter after seven 
 I was down to my last cigarette 
 And the clock in the window 
 Had it quarter to eleven 
 I was watching all the people 
 Passing by me, going places 
 Just the loneliest guy in the town 
 Looking for a friendly smile 
 But all that I could see were faces 
 And then, just like the taste of milk and honey 
 I found the stranger I'd been looking for 
 The way my cup of love was overflowing 
 I knew the stranger in the crowd 
 And I would be strangers no more 
 Love that found us on the corner 
 At a quarter to eleven 
 I thought you were to good to be true 
 All my life I had believed 
 That angels only live in heaven 
 But now, we share the taste of milk and honey 
 Each day is sweeter than the day before 
 My cup of love is overflowing 
 Because the stranger in the crowd 
 And I would be strangers no more 
 Deep inside, my cup of love was overflowing 
 I found the stranger I'd been looking for 
 THe way my cup of love was overflowing 
 I knew the stranger in the crowd 
 And I would be strangers no more
