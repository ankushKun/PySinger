I know I'd go from rags to riches 
 If you would only say you cared 
 And though my pockets may be empty 
 I'd be a millionaire 
 My clothes may still be torn and tattered 
 But in my heart I'd be a king 
 Your love is all that ever mattered 
 It's everything 
 So open your arms and you'll open the door 
 To all the treasure that I'm living for 
 Hold me and kiss me and tell me you're mine evermore 
 Must I forever stay a beggar 
 Whose golden dreams will not come true 
 Or will I go from rags to riches 
 My fate is up to you
