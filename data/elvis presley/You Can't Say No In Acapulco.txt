You can't say no, in Acapulco 
 With every beat your heart will answer yes 
 Where lovers sing instead of talk 
 And dance instead of walk together 
 In a night, that's filled with stars 
 And strumming guitars 
 You can't say no, in Acapulco 
 Where romance blooms, and love is in the air 
 So kiss me tender, love me true 
 Darling feel this magic too 
 Don't say no, you can't say no, in Acapulco 
 You can't say no, in Acapulco 
 Where romance blooms, and love is in the air 
 So kiss me tender, love me true 
 Darling feel this magic too 
 Don't say no, you can't say no, in Acapulco 
 Don't say no... you can't say no, in Acapulco
