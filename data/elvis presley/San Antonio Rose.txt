... Remember alone in my heart 
 Call back my love of San Antonio 
 Just pretend like tales fall apart 
 Think once again of my love, my own 
 A few words not known ... my heart I belong... 
 I don't know... of my rose in San Antonio 
 Growing all this tender lala heart 
 Call back my love in San Antonio 
 It's so sweet and tender like peddles fall apart... 
 Rose in San Antonio... know my rose in San Antonio
