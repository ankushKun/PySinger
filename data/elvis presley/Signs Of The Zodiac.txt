Tony is a Capricorn, a leader of men 
 And he has a kinda stubborn streak 
 But when it comes to the opposite sex 
 Tony's kinda shy and weak 
 Oh, but he can be hot stuff 
 See the look on his face 
 If you want a wedding 
 It's him you've gotta chase 
 Uh, uh, uh

 Michael is a Scorpio; he can't make up his mind 
 Poor boy he can't decide at all 
 He wants one girl and then another 
 Soon there'll be none left but mother 
 Oh, but, Michael, that won't do 
 That just won't do at all 
 You can't marry your mother 
 Your mother's much too tall, ha ha, ho ho
