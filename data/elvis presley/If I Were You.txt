The sandman comes to my house late each night 
 But it's way in the morning before he turns out my life 
 It's times like this my darling I can see 
 If I were you I'd know that I love me 
 The great snowman I've been called by all 
 But it looks like this time I'm gonna fall 
 It's times like this my darling I can see 
 Ooh if I were you I'd know that I love me 
 Wind and rain and storm closin' in on me 
 I've walked the streets alone with my self sympathy 
 Can you hear me saying hopefully 
 Ooh if I were you I'd know that I love me 
 Wind and rain and storm closin' in on me 
 I've walked the streets alone with my self sympathy 
 Can you hear me saying hopefully 
 If I were you I'd know that I love me 
 Ooh if I were you I'd know that I love me 
 If I were you I'd know that I love me
