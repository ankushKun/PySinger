(Big love, big heartache) 
 (Big love, big heartache) 
 (Big love, big heartache) 
 Oh yes, I know it's true 
 The more you fall in love 
 The more your heart can break in two 
 (Big love, big heartache) 
 Now that you've said goodbye 
 For every tender kiss 
 I've had the tears I cry 
 I gave my heart and soul 
 All the love I knew 
 Oh, how much it hurts me now 
 To know that we are through 
 (Big love, big heartache) 
 I'll always feel this way 
 My arms will be so empty 
 Till you return some day and say 
 Your love, yes your big love 
 Will be here to stay 
 Till then it's 
 (Big love, big heartache) 
 (Big love, big heartache) 
 Your love, yes your big love 
 Will be here to stay
