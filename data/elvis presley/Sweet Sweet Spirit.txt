There's a sweet sweet spirit in this place 
 And I know that it's the spirit of the Lord 
 There are sweet expressions on each face 
 And I know that it's the presence of the Lord 
 Sweet Holy Spirit 
 Sweet heavenly dove 
 Stay right here with us 
 Filling us with your love 
 And for these blessings 
 We lift our hearts in praise (hearts in praise) 
 Without a doubt we'll know that we have been revived 
 When we shall leave this place
