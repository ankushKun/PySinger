I could wander the byway, rewander too 
 But it wouldn't be the same without you 
 Those familiair old places would just make me blue 
 'Cause it wouldn't be the same without you 
 I wasted my love on a careless romance 
 But I'd do it again, if I had the chance 
 I could start my life over with somebody new 
 But it wouldn't be the same without you 
 I wasted my love on a careless romance 
 But I'd do it again, if I had the chance 
 I could start my life over with somebody new 
 But it wouldn't be the same without you
