If I could be you, if you could be me 
 For just one hour 
 If we could find a way 
 To get inside each other's mind 
 If you could see you through my eyes 
 Instead your own ego 
 I believe you'd be 
 I believe you'd be surprised to see 
 That you've been blind 
 Walk a mile in my shoes 
 Just walk a mile in my shoes 
 Yeah, before you abuse, criticize and accuse 
 Then walk a mile in my shoes 
 Now if we spend the day 
 Throwin' stones at one another 
 'Cause I don't think, 'cause I don't think 
 Or wear my hair the same way you do 
 Well, I may be common people 
 But I'm your brother 
 And when you strike out 
 You're tryin' to hurt me 
 It's hurtin' you, Lord have mercy 
 Walk a mile in my shoes 
 Walk a mile in my shoes 
 Yeah, before you abuse, criticize and accuse 
 Walk a mile in my shoes 
 Now there are people on reservations 
 And out in the ghetto 
 And brother, there but for the grace of God 
 Go you and I 
 If I only had wings of a little angel 
 Don't you know I'd fly 
 To the top of a mountain 
 And then I'd cry, cry, cry 
 Walk a mile in my shoes 
 Walk a mile in my shoes 
 Yeah, before you abuse, criticize and accuse 
 Walk a mile in my shoes 
 Walk a mile in my shoes 
 Walk a mile in my shoes 
 Yeah, before you abuse, criticize and accuse 
 Walk a mile in my shoes
