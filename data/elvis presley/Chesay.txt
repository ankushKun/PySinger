What's in the drink, chase the devil away 
 Magic I think so I just say chesay 
 Chesay, chesay bring you good luck night and day 
 Chesay, chesay that's the gypsy way 
 Trouble is my middle name, though it's such a crying shame 
 Try and try there's nothing I can do 
 But I'm feeling kinda strange, feel like things are going to change 
 Time my lucky star was shining through 
 Chesay, chesay bring you good luck night and day 
 Chesay, chesay that's the gypsy way 
 Drink a cup of gypsy love just tip it up and then you just say chesay 
 Swallow once then swallow twice, goes down so nice just say chesay. hey! 
 What's in the drink, chase the devil away 
 Magic I think so I just say chesay 
 Chesay, chesay bring you good luck night and day 
 Chesay, chesay that's the gypsy way 
 Chesay, chesay brings you good luck night and day 
 Chesay, chesay that's the gypsy way 
 Chesay, chesay brings you good luck night and day 
 Chesay, chesay that's the gypsy way 
 Chesay
