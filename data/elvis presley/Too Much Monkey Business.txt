Salesman talking to me tried to run me up a creek 
 Says you can buy it, go on try it, you can pay me next week 
 Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business 
 Too much monkey business for me to be involved in 
 Blonde haired, good lookin' tryin' to get me hooked 
 Wants me to marry, settle down and get a home and and write a book 
 Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business 
 Too much monkey business for me to be involved in 
 Pay phone, somethin' wrong, dime gone 
 Well me ought to sue the operator for tellin' me a tale 
 Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business 
 Too much monkey business for me to be involved in 
 Been to Vietnam, been a fightin' in the war 
 Army bar, army chow, army clothes, army car 
 Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business 
 Too much monkey business for me to be involved in 
 Workin' in the fillin' station, too many tasks 
 Wipe the windo', check the tires, check the oil, dole the gas 
 Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business 
 Too much monkey business for me to be involved in 
 Blonde haired, good lookin' tryin' to get me hooked 
 Wants me to marry, get a home, settle down and and write a book 
 Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business 
 Too much monkey business for me to be involved in 
 Too much monkey business, too much monkey business 
 Too much monkey business, too much monkey business 
 Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
