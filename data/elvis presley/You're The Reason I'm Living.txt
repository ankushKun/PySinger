You're the reason I'm livin' 
 Oh, you carry me through 
 All of life's little burdens 
 I'd be lost without you 
 You're the reason I do things 
 You're the things that I do 
 You're the reason I'm livin' 
 I'd be lost without you 
 A long, long time ago 
 When I was down 
 Oh, dear, you took me in and showed me 
 True love still could be found 
 You're the reason I do things 
 You're the things that I do 
 You're the reason I'm livin' 
 I'd be lost without you 
 You're the reason I'm livin' 
 I'd be lost without you 
 You're the reason I'm livin' 
 I'd be lost without you
