The walls have ears 
 Ears that hear each little sound you make 
 Every time you stamp through a lamp 
 And every cup and dish you break 
 But they can't hear a kiss 
 Or two arms that hold you tight 
 So come on baby 
 Don't fight tonight 
 The walls have ears 
 Better think before you fling that shoe 
 If you part my hair with a chair 
 They'll spread the news to Timbuktu 
 But they can't hear a kiss 
 Or two arms that hold you tight 
 So come on baby 
 Don't fight tonight 
 Jets can fly, fast and high 
 Rockets can go even faster 
 But they can't catch or even match 
 Sound traveling through plaster 
 The walls have ears 
 Ears that hear each little sound you make 
 Every time you stamp through a lamp 
 And every cup and dish you break 
 But they can't hear a kiss 
 Or two arms that hold you tight 
 So come on baby 
 Don't fight tonight 
 Just in tonight 
 Don't fight tonight
