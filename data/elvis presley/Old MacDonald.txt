Old macdonald had a farm, ee-i-ee-i-o 
 And on that farm he had some chicks, ee-i-ee-i-o 
 With a cluck, cluck here, a cluck, cluck there 
 Loud as they could be 
 And when those chicks got out of line 
 Chicken fricassee 
 With a cluck, cluck here, and a cluck, cluck there 
 Loud as they could be 
 And when those chicks got out of line 
 Chicken fricassee 
 Well, old macdonald had a farm, ee-i-ee-i-o 
 And on that farm he had some cows, ee-i-ee-i-o 
 With a moo moo here, a moo moo there 
 Cattle everywhere 
 And when those cows got out of line

 With a moo moo here, a moo moo there 
 Cattle everywhere 
 And when those cows got out of line 
 Hamburger, medium rare

 And on that farm he had some pigs, ee-i-ee-i-o 
 With an oink, oink here, an oink, oink there 
 Pigs everywhere in sight 
 And when those pigs got out of line 
 Pork and beans at night 
 With an oink, oink here, an oink, oink there

 Pork and beans at night
