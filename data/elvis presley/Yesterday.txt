Yesterday 
 All my troubles seemed so far away 
 Now it looks as though they're here to stay 
 Oh, I believe in yesterday 
 Suddenly 
 (suddenly, ooh) 
 I'm not half the man I used to be 
 There's a shadow hanging over me 
 Oh, yesterday, came suddenly 
 Why she had to go 
 I don't know, she wouldn't say 
 I said something wrong 
 Now I long for yesterday 
 Yesterday 
 (yesterday, ooh) 
 Love was such an easy game to play 
 Now I need a place to hide away 
 Oh, I believe in yesterday 
 Why she had to go 
 I don't know, she wouldn't say 
 I said something wrong 
 Now I long for yesterday 
 Yesterday 
 (yesterday, ooh) 
 Love was such an easy game to play 
 Now I need a place to hide away 
 Oh, I believe in yesterday 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
