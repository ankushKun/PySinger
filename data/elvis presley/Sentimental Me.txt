Sentimental me 
 Guess I'll always will be 
 So in love with you 
 Say you love me too 
 Sentimental me 
 Dreaming while I live 
 Living just to give 
 All my love to you 
 No one else will do 
 Sentimental me 
 Reaching for the moon 
 Wishing on the stars 
 On my honeymoon 
 I want to be where you are 
 Darling can't you see 
 It was meant to be 
 I'm in love with you 
 Say you love me too 
 Sentimental me 
 Darling can't you see 
 It was meant to be 
 I'm in love with you 
 No-one else will do
