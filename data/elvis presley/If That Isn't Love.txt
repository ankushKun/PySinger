He left the splendor of heaven 
 Knowing his destiny 
 Was the lonely hill of Golgotha 
 There to lay down His life for me 
 And if that isn't love 
 Then the ocean is dry 
 There's no stars in the sky 
 And the little sparrows can't fly 
 Yeah, if that isn't love 
 Then heaven's a myth 
 There's no feeling like this 
 If that isn't love 
 (it's got to be love) 
 Even in death He remembered 
 The thief hanging by his side 
 Then He spoke of love and compassion 
 And He took him to paradise 
 And if that isn't love 
 Then the ocean is dry 
 There's no stars in the sky 
 And the little sparrows can't fly 
 Oh yeah, if that isn't love 
 Then heaven's a myth 
 There's no feeling like this 
 If that isn't love 
 It's got to be love
