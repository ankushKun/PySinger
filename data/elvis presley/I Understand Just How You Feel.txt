Do you remember the love we had for each other 
 I was your faithy... 
 I miss you so 
 Please believe me when I tell you 
 I just can't stand to see you go, you know 
 Please understand just how I feel 
 Your love for me might not reveal 
 And if you know this time it's real 
 We understood (?) 
 I miss you so 
 Please believe me when I tell you 
 I just can't stand to see you go, you know 
 Please understand just how I feel 
 Come back to me, my love is real 
 And you will know this timeless feel 
 Will understand 
 Will understand
