Ku-u-i-po, I love you more today 
 More today than yesterday 
 But I love you less today 
 Less than I will tomorrow 
 See the sweet hawaiian rose 
 See it blossom, see it grow 
 That's the story of our love 
 Ever since we said hello 
 Ku-u-i-po, I love you more today 
 More today than yesterday 
 But I love you less today 
 Less than I will tomorrow 
 As the years go passing by 
 We'll recall our wedding day 
 I will be there by your side 
 You will always hear me say 
 Ku-u-i-po, I love you more today 
 More today than yesterday 
 But I love you less today 
 Less than I will tomorrow 
 Ku-u-i-po, you're my hawaiian sweetheart
