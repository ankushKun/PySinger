One thought of you, 
 My heart begins churning 
 I feel return 
 To a fountain of love 
 My lips and eyes, 
 They ache to be near you 
 To hold you here 
 In my fountain of love 
 Never be blue 
 Should your world start sinking 
 Just come and drink 
 From my fountain of love 
 We'll build a new world off 
 On a high mountain 
 We'll live 
 On our fountain of love
