Once I stood in the night with my head bowed low 
 In the darkness as black as could be 
 And my heart felt alone and I cried,"Oh Lord 
 Don't hide Your face from me" 
 Like a king I may live in a palace so tall 
 With great riches to call my own 
 But I don't know a thing in this whole wide world 
 That's worse than being alone 
 Hold my hand all the way, every hour every day 
 Come here to the great unknown 
 Take my hand, let me stand 
 Where no one stands alone 
 Take my hand, let me stand 
 Where no one stands alone
