As I walk along I wonder 
 What went wrong with our love 
 A love that was so strong 
 And as I still walk by 
 I think off the times we've had together 
 While our hearts were young 
 I'm a-walking in the rain 
 Hear it falling and I feel the pain 
 Wishing you were here by me 
 To end this misery 
 And I wonder 
 Why 
 (Why, I wonder) 
 You went away 
 Yes, I wonder, where you will stay 
 My little runaway 
 Run, run, run, run, runaway 
 I'm a-walking in the rain 
 Hear it falling and I feel the pain 
 Wishing you were here by me 
 To end this misery 
 And I wonder 
 (I wonder) 
 Why 
 (Why, why, why, why, why) 
 You went away 
 Yes, I wonder, where you will stay 
 My little runaway 
 Run, run, run, run, runaway 
 Run, run, run, run, runaway 
 Run, run, run, run, runaway
