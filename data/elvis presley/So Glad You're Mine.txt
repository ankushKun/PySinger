My baby's long and tall 
 She's like a cannonball 
 Say, every time she loves me 
 Lordly, you can hear me squall 
 She cried, ooh-wee 
 I believe I'll change my mind 
 She said, "I'm so glad I'm living" 
 I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine" 
 My baby knows just how 
 To treat me right 
 Gives me plenty loving 
 Morning, noon, and night 
 She cried, ooh-wee 
 I believe I'll change my mind 
 She said, "I'm so glad I'm living" 
 I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine" 
 When my baby does what she does to me 
 I climb the highest mountain 
 Dive in the deepest sea 
 She cried, ooh-wee 
 I believe I'll change my mind 
 She said, "I'm so glad I'm living" 
 I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine" 
 My baby's lips are red 
 And sweet like wine 
 And when she kisses me 
 I get high every time 
 She cried, ooh-wee 
 I believe I'll change my mind 
 She said, "I'm so glad I'm living" 
 I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"
