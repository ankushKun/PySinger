Maybe it's too late. sometimes I even hate myself for loving you 
 Trying to be strong then nighttime comes along and I start loving you 
 Wanting you. where is all my self control I'm burning way down in my soul 
 And needing you, and wishing I could be the man, I try to 
 Hating me for wanting you to be with you knowing you don't love me like you used to 
 But it's midnight, oh and I miss you 
 It's getting late and I know that's when I am weak 
 Funny how things have a way of looking so much brighter in the day light 
 I ought to go to bed to try and straighten out my head and just forget you 
 Oh but it's midnight yes and I miss you 
 It's getting late and I know that's when I am weak 
 Funny how things have a way of looking so much brighter in the day light 
 I ought to go to bed to try and straighten out my head and just forget you 
 Oh but it's midnight yes and I miss you 
 It's midnight and I miss you
