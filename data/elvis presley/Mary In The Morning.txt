Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning 
 When through a sleepy haze I see her lying there 
 Soft as the rain that falls on summer flowers 
 Warm as the sunlight shining on her golden hair 
 When I awake and see her there so close beside me 
 I want to take her in my arms, 
 The ache is there so deep inside me 
 Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning 
 Chasing a rainbow in her dreams so far away 
 And when she turns to touch it I kiss her face so softly 
 And then my Mary wakes to love another day 
 And Mary's there in sunny days or stormy weather 
 She doesn't care, cause right or wrong the love we share, 
 We share together 
 Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the evening 
 Kissed by the shades of night and starlight in her hair 
 And as we walk, I hold her close beside me 
 All our tomorrows for a lifetime we will share 
 And Mary's there, and Mary's there and Mary's there
