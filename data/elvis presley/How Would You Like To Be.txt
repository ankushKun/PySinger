How would you like to be a little circus clown? 
 And you could wear a smile instead of a frown 
 How would you like to be a little kangaroo? 
 A-hoppin' up and down, and I could hop with you 
 Come on and smile a little, smile a little 
 Hop a little, hop a little 
 Smile a little, hop a little bit with me 
 Come on and smile a little, smile a little 
 Hop a little, hop a little 
 Smile a little, hop a little bit with me 
 Oh ho, ha ha 
 A-tra la la la la la la 
 A ha 
 Tra la la la la la la 
 How would you like to be a little buzzing bee? 
 And instead of a tree, you could buzz around me 
 How would you like to be a little mocking bird? 
 And you can sing me songs like I never heard 
 Come on and buzz a little, buzz a little 
 Sing a little, sing a little 
 Buzz a little, sing a little bit with me 
 Buzz, buzz, buzz a little 
 Do re mi a little 
 Buzz a little, sing a little bit with me 
 Oh ho, a-ha 
 A-tra la la la la la la 
 A-ha 
 Tra la la la la la la 
 How would you like to be a little baby bear? 
 And you can hug me tight any time you care 
 How would you like to be a little dancing doll? 
 And you could dance with me every time I call 
 Oh-ho 
 Tra la la la la la la 
 Oh-ho, ah-ah 
 Tra la la la la la la
