Girl happy, yes I'm girl happy, 
 Girl happy, can't you see 
 Every girl I see looks good to me 
 What crazy way I were to be 
 I love a life of nothing but beautiful women 
 Well I'm girl happy, yes I'm girl happy, 
 Girl happy, can't you see 
 Every time I see a pretty face 
 My heart just heads for outer space 
 I need a girl to make my life worth of living 
 Yes, I'm girl happy, yes I'm girl happy, 
 Girl happy, can't you see 
 I've been like this since I was just a baby boy 
 First nurse that rocked my cradle made me jump to joy 
 Mama keep your daughter out of sight 
 I'm in a lovin' mood tonight 
 I love a life of nothing but beautiful women 
 Well I'm girl happy, yes I'm girl happy, 
 Girl happy, can't you see 
 I've been like this since I was just a baby boy 
 First nurse that rocked my cradle made me jump to joy 
 Girl happy, well I'm girl happy, 
 Yes I'm girl happy, can't you see 
 Girl happy, said I'm girl happy, 
 Yes I'm girl happy, can't you see
