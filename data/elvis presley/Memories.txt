Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind 
 Memories, sweetened through the ages just like wine 
 Quiet thoughts come floating down 
 And settle softly to the ground 
 Like golden autumn leaves around my feet 
 I touched them and they burst apart with sweet memories, 
 Sweet memories 
 Of holding hands and red bouquets 
 And twilight trimmed in purple haze 
 And laughing eyes and simple ways 
 And quiet nights and gentle days with you 
 Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind 
 Memories, sweetened through the ages just like wine, 
 Memories, memories, sweet memories
