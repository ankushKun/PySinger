Lord, help me walk 
 Another mile, just one more mile 
 I'm tired of walkin' all alone 
 Lord, help me smile 
 Another smile, just one more smile 
 You know I just can't make it on my own 
 I never thought I needed help before 
 I thought that I could get by by myself 
 But now I know I just can't take it anymore 
 With a humble heart on bended knee 
 I'm beggin' you please, help me 
 Come down from your golden throne 
 To me, to lowly me 
 I need to feel the touch of your tender hand 
 Remove the chains of darkness 
 And let me see, Lord let me see 
 Just where I fit into your master plan 
 I never thought I needed help before 
 I thought that I could get by by myself 
 But now I know I just can't take it anymore 
 With a humble heart on bended knee 
 I'm beggin' you please, help me 
 With a humble heart on bended knee 
 I'm beggin' you please, help me
