When I think of how he came so far from glory 
 Came to dwell among the lowly such as I 
 To suffer shame and such disgrace 
 On mount calvary take my place 
 Then I ask myself this question 
 Who am I? 
 Who am I that the king would bleed and die for? 
 Who am I that he would pray not my will, thine lord? 
 The answer I may never know 
 Why he ever loved me so 
 That to an old rugged cross he'd go 
 For who am I? 
 When I'm reminded of his words 
 I'll leave you never 
 If you'll be true I'll give to you life forever 
 Oh I wonder what I could have done 
 To deserve god's only son 
 To fight my battles until they're won 
 For who am I? 
 Who am I that the king would bleed and die for 
 Who am I that he would pray not my will, thine lord 
 The answer I may never know 
 Why he ever loved me so 
 That to an old rugged cross he'd go 
 For who am I? 
 That to an old rugged cross he'd go, for who am I?
