Well baby I'm gonna teach you what love's all about tonight 
 Trust me honey everything's gonna be all right 
 You gotta do like I do there ain't nothing to it 
 Listen to me baby anybody can do it 
 All you gotta do is just let yourself go 
 Now don't be afraid just relax and take it real slow 
 Cool it baby you ain't got no place to go 
 Just put your arms around me real tight 
 Enjoy yourself baby don't fight 
 All you gotta do is just let yourself go 
 All you need is just a little rehearsal 
 The first thing that you know 
 You'll be ready for the grand finale 
 So come on baby let's go 
 Let's go, let's go' let's go 
 Let's go 
 Take a real deep breath and put your warm red lips on mine 
 Just do like I tell you, everything's gonna be just fine 
 Kiss me nice and easy, take your time 
 Baby I'm the only one here in line 
 All you gotta do is just let yourself go 
 Let yourself go right now Yeh! let yourself go 
 Let yourself go right now Yeh! let yourself go 
 Yeh! let yourself go 
 All you gotta do is just let yourself go
