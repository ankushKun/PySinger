All right 
 Well I'll be back, yeah, I'll be back 
 Like a homesick train on a one-way track 
 I got to travel and hit the gravel 
 But I'll be back, yeah, I'll be back 
 Yeah! I'll return, I shall return 
 Don't cool those lips, we're gonna see 'em burn 
 'Cause I'll be missin' your kinda kissin' 
 But I'll be back 
 Yeah, I'll be back 
 Yeah, there ain't nobody tell me stay or go, oh no 
 And no one tells the four winds where to blow, oh 
 I'll be back, I'm comin' back 
 Don't throw away that welcome mat 
 The door I'm hopin' will still be open 
 A teeny weenie crack to your shack 
 So keep that love light burnin', I'll be back 
 Yeah, I'll be back 
 Yeah, there ain't nobody tell me stay or go, oh no 
 And no one tells the four winds where to blow, oh 
 I'll be back, I'm comin' back 
 Don't throw away that welcome mat 
 The door I'm hopin' will still be open 
 A teeny weenie crack to your shack 
 So keep that love light burnin', I'll be back 
 Yeah, I'll be back
