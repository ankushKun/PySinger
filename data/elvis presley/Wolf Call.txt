Flip, flop a-kay-eye 
 What a cutie pie I see, 
 (yeah yeah) 
 Oops shoopa doo-wah 
 Lips of honey that's for me 
 (yeah yeah) 
 Shim sham shimmie 
 Wanna howl and shout 
 I might forget you baby 
 There's no doubt 
 I saw you standing 'gainst the wall 
 (wall) 
 I whistled and I gave my all 
 (all) 
 Now don't tell me you don't fall 
 For that wolf call 
 Just a little kiss'll put me in a whirl 
 I'll never whistle dearie at another girl 
 You love me well we'll have a ball 
 (ball) 
 Why do you try to stall 
 (stall) 
 Now don't tell me you don't fall 
 For that wolf call 
 For that wolf call 
 For that wolf call
