 (Girls) in bikinis, 
 A walkin' and wigglin' by, yay, yay, yay 
 (Girls) on the beaches,

 So pretty, lord I could cry 
 I'm just a red-blooded boy 
 And I can't stop thinkin' 'bout

 They'll drive me out of my mind, yay, yay, yay 
 (Girls) big and brassy, 
 (Girls) small and sassy, 
 Just give me one of each kind, yay, yay 
 I'm just a red-blooded boy 
 And I can't stop thinkin' about 
 Girls! girls! girls! girls!

 A crunchy crunchety 
 A crunchety crunch 
 I never ever get to finish my lunch

 (Girls) in tight sweaters, 
 (Girls) in short dresses, 
 A walkin' and wigglin' by, yay, yay, yay

 I'm just a red-blooded boy 
 And I can't stop thinkin' about 
 Girls! girls! girls! girls! girls! girls! 
 I'm just a red-blooded boy 
 And I can't stop thinkin' 'bout 
 Girls! girls! girls! girls! 
 Girls! girls! girls! girls! 
 Girls! girls! girls! girls!
