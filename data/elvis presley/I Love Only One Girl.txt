Oh, I love only one girl 
 The one I got my arms around 
 I love only one girl 
 One in every town 
 In Paris there is Mimi and when the moon is bright 
 I love to take her walking along the Seine each night 
 I kiss her on the left, I kiss her on the right 
 Oh, I love only one girl 
 The one I got my arms around 
 I love only one girl 
 One in every town 
 I'm proud of my Brunhilda in Frankfurt on the Rhine 
 Oh she's a lot of woman and all of her is mine 
 Oh she can lift a Steinway as easy as a stein 
 Oh, I love only one girl 
 The one I got my arms around 
 I love only one girl 
 One in every town 
 In Naples there's Maria, how she can cook and flirt 
 You can't beat her lasagna, I eat until I hurt 
 And then she tops it off with amore for dessert 
 Oh, I love only one girl 
 The one I got my arms around 
 I love only one girl 
 One in every town 
 Oh, I love only one girl 
 The one I got my arms around 
 I love only one girl 
 One in every town 
 I love only one girl 
 I love only one girl 
 I love only one girl 
 I love only one girl 
 She's the girl for me
