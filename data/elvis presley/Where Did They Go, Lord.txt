The words of her promise 
 The flame of her faith 
 The love that would never drift away 
 Where did they go Lord, where did they go? 
 You know somehow forever 
 Slipped out of my hands 
 And my dreams ran away with the wind 
 Where did they go Lord, where did they go 
 You know sometimes I wish 
 I had lost her to another 
 Well but Lord she just walked off all alone 
 And the heart that's within me is not bitter just hurt 
 And bewildered because her love had gone 
 Oh the passion I trusted 
 The truth that I leaned on 
 And the hope that would forever keep me strong 
 I cry out my questions 
 Oh, the answers are all gone 
 Where did they go Lord, tell me where did they go 
 Where did they go Lord, tell me where did they go
