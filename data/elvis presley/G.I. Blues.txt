They give us a room 
 With a view of the beautiful Rhine 
 They give us a room 
 With a view of the beautiful Rhine 
 Gimme a muddy old creek 
 In Texas any old time 
 I've got those hup, two, three, four 
 Occupation G.I. Blues 
 From my G.I. hair to the heels of my G.I. shoes 
 And if I don't go stateside soon 
 I'm gonna blow my fuse 
 We get hasenpfeffer 
 And black pumpernickel for chow 
 We get hasenpfeffer 
 And black pumpernickel for chow 
 I'd blow my next month's pay 
 For a slice of Texas cow 
 We'd like to be heroes, 
 But all that we do here is march 
 We'd like to be heroes, 
 But all that we do here is march 
 And they don't give the Purple Heart 
 For a fallen arch 
 I've got those hup, two, three, four 
 Occupation G.I. Blues 
 From my G.I. hair to the heels of my G.I. shoes 
 And if I don't go stateside soon 
 I'm gonna blow my fuse 
 The frauleins are pretty as flowers 
 But we can't make a pass 
 The frauleins are pretty as flowers 
 But we can't make a pass 
 'Cause they're all wearin' signs saying: 
 "Keepen sie off the grass" 
 I've got those hup, two, three, four 
 Occupation G.I. Blues 
 From my G.I. hair to the heels of my G.I. shoes 
 And if I don't go stateside soon 
 I'm gonna blow my fuse
