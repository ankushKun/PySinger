I remember my first love affair 
 Somehow or another the whole darn thing went wrong 
 My mamma had some great advice 
 So I thought I'd put it into words of this song 
 I can still hear her sayin' it 
 Boy, Oh, I see you're sittin' out there all alone 
 Cryin' your eyes out 'cause the woman that you love has gone 
 Oh, there's gonna be, there's gonna be a whole lot of trouble in your life 
 Oh, so listen to me get up off your knees 'cause only the strong survive 
 That's what she said, only the strong survive 
 Only the strong survive, 
 Oh you've got to be strong, you'd better hold on 
 Don't go all around with your head hung down 
 Well I wouldn't let that little girl 
 No, I wouldn't let her know that she made me feel like a clown 
 There's a whole lot a girls lookin' for a good man like you 
 Oh but you'll never meet 'em if you give up now and say that your life is through 
 Yes she said: Only the strong survive, only the strong survive, 
 You've got to be a man, you've got to take a stand 
 Only the strong survive, only the strong survive, 
 Oh, you've got to be strong, you'd better hold on 
 'Cause only the strong survive 
 Only the strong survive, only the strong survive, 
 Well, you've got to be a man, you've got to take a stand 
 Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
