Oh, how I love Jesus 
 Oh, how I love Jesus 
 Oh, how I love Jesus 
 Because He first loved me 
 When I am discouraged 
 And I feel the gloom 
 God sends His angel 
 To see Him my broom 
 IU hear the singing 
 I'm satisfied 
 I know, I know 
 That Jesus is mine 
 Oh, how I love Jesus 
 (He is so wonderful) 
 Oh, how I love Jesus 
 (He is so wonderful) 
 Oh, how I love Jesus 
 (He is so wonderful) 
 To know that Jesus is mine 
 Oh, how I love Jesus 
 (He is so wonderful) 
 Oh, how I love Jesus 
 (He is so wonderful) 
 Oh, how I love Jesus 
 (He is so wonderful) 
 To know that Jesus is mine
