They say you found somebody new 
 Whose love will always be true 
 I don't know what it is to be alone 
 That's why I dread to know you're gone 
 Oh Judy, don't let our sweet love 
 Wither and die like flowers in the fall 
 Oh Judy, don't you know it's you 
 I love most of all 
 Oh, please come back I promise always to be true 
 Oh Judy, there'll never be anyone else dear but you 
 Oh, please come back I promise always to be true 
 Oh Judy, there'll never be anyone else dear but you
