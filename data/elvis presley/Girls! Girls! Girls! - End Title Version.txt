Girls! Girls! Girls! Girls! 
 Girls, goin' swimming, girls, in bikinis 
 Girls walkin' and a wigglin' by, yay, yay, yay 
 Girls, on the beaches, girls, oh, what a peaches 
 Girls, so pretty, Lord I could cry, yay, yay 
 I'm just a red blooded boy 
 And I can't stop thinkin' about 'em 
 Girls, sailin' sailboats, girls, water skiin' 
 Girls, they'll drive me out of my mind, yay, yay, yay 
 Girls, big and brassy, girls, small and sassy 
 Girls, just give me one of each kind, yay, yay 
 I'm just a red blooded boy 
 And I can't stop thinkin' about 'em 
 Girls! Girls! Girls! Girls! 
 And when I pick up a sandwich too much 
 A crunchy crunchety, a crunchety crunch 
 I never ever get to finish my lunch 
 Because there's always bound to be a bunch of 
 Girls, in tight sweaters, girls, in short dresses 
 Girls, walkin' and a wigglin' by, yay, yay, yay 
 Girls, out boatin', girls, just a floatin' 
 Girls, so pretty, Lord I could cry, yay, yay 
 I'm just a red blooded boy 
 And I can't stop thinkin' about 'em 
 Girls! Girls! Girls! Girls! 
 I'm just a red blooded boy 
 And I can't stop thinkin' about 'em 
 Girls! Girls! Girls! Girls! 
 Girls! Girls! Girls! Girls! 
 Girls! Girls!
