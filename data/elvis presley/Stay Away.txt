Ten thousand miles even though I roam 
 I can hear the call of the hills of home 
 The canyons high and the valleys low 
 Echo how can you stay away 
 My dreams are there where the eagle flies 
 Where the mountain tops seem to touch the sky 
 The winding streams and the winds that blow 
 Ask me how can you stay away 
 Far too long have I stayed apart 
 From this land that I love and divide my heart 
 Now, now I know I must go 
 Where the hills say don't stay away 
 Where the hills say don't stay away
