When I was a little bitty boy 
 Sittin' on my papa's knee 
 I still remember 
 Every word my papa said to me 
 Now boy if you ever meet 
 A pretty woman walking down the street 
 You'd better stop real still 
 Look both ways 
 Listen 
 Or you'll get in trouble 
 When you see her go struttin' by 
 Giving you that evil eye 
 And she got a kind of dreamy look 
 Just enough to get you shook 
 Now boy don't you lose your head 
 You pay attention what your papa said 
 You'd better stop real still 
 Look both ways 
 Listen 
 Or you'll get in trouble 
 All right! 
 She'll drive you crazy with the way she walks 
 She'll drive you crazy with the way she talks 
 And you'll think you're gonna lose your mind 
 'Cause that pretty woman looks so fine 
 And the very first thing you'll know 
 You'll be tellin' her you love her so 
 You'd better stop real still
