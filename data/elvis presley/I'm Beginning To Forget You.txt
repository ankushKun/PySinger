I'm beginning to forget you 
 That old heartache is gone 
 I'm beginning to sleep at night 
 No more crying till dawn 
 I can hear your name mentioned 
 And it brings no misery 
 I'm beginnin to forget you 
 Like you forgot me 
 I'm beginning to smile again 
 After crying for so long 
 I can hear the tune we loved so well 
 And it's just another song 
 I'm so happy that it's over 
 I'm so thankful to be free 
 I'm beginnin to forget you 
 Like you forgot me
