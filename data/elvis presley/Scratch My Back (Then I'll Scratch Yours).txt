One good turn deserves another 
 Be my love, I'll be your lover 
 It's all part of nature's laws 
 If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch yours. 
 If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch your back 
 Like two peas in a pack, let's get rid of our itch together, hmm 
 Joy they say is in the giving 
 Come on give, make life worth living 
 Your welfare is my concern 
 Do a favour for me, I'll do one in return 
 If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch your back 
 Like two peas in a pack, let's get rid of our itch together, hmm 
 Scratch me now a little lower 
 What a feeling do it slower 
 That's it, hmm you're getting hot 
 Well I gotta admit, you just hit the spot 
 If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch your back 
 Like two peas in a pack, let's get rid of our itch together, hmm 
 If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch your back
