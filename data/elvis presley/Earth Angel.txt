Earth Angel, Earth Angel 
 Will you be mine 
 My darling dear 
 Love you all the time 
 I'm just a fool 
 A fool in love with you 
 Earth Angel, Earth Angel 
 The one I adore 
 Love you forever and ever more 
 I'm just a fool 
 A fool in love with you 
 I fell for you 
 And I knew 
 The vision of your lov-loveliness 
 I hoped and I prayed that someday 
 That I'd be the vision of your hap-happiness 
 Oh, Oh 
 Earth Angel, Earth Angel 
 Please be mine 
 My darling dear 
 Love you all the time 
 I'm just a fool 
 A fool in love with you
