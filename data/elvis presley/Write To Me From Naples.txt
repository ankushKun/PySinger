Write to me from Naples 
 Tell me all that's new 
 I loved you in Naples 
 More than words can say 
 Call me cara mia 
 Tell me all that's new 
 Write to me from Naples 
 Keep my heart with you 
 I can hear a mandolino 
 Softly it cries 
 While I raise a glass of vino 
 Praising your eyes 
 Since we said a rivederci 
 My poor heart cries 
 Just for a letter from you 
 Write to me from Naples 
 Tell me all that's new 
 Write to me from Naples 
 Keep my heart with you 
 Please come back, come back to me
