Well a hundred years from now I won't be crying 
 A hundred years from now I won't be blue 
 My heart will have to forget that we ever met 
 But I won't care a hundred years from now 
 I'll never forget sweetheart the night you told me 
 That you could Live without my love somehow 
 That's all in the past I knew it wouldn't last 
 But I won't care a hundred years from now
