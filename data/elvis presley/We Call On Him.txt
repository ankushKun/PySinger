We call on him 
 Whenever storm clouds gather 
 We call on him to light our darkest day 
 Why must it be that only when we're lonely 
 And hopes are dim, we call on him 
 Why don't we call on him before we lose our way 
 To count our blessings and thank him while we may 
 We call on him 
 When no one else will answer 
 We ask of him a reason to go on 
 When our cup of joy becomes a cup of sorrow 
 Filled to the brim, we call on him 
 Why don't we call on him before we lose our way 
 To count our blessings and thank him while we may
