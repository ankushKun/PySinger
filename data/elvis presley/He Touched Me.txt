Shackled by the heavy burden 
 'Neath a load of guilt and shame 
 Then the hand of Jesus touched me 
 (He touched me) 
 And now I am no longer the same 
 For He touched me 
 Oh, He touched me 
 He touched me 
 And now all the wonderful joy that floods my soul 
 Something happened and now I know 
 He touched me and made me whole 
 Oh, since I met this blessed Savior 
 And since He cleansed and made me whole 
 Oh I'm with the saints 
 With the saints to praise Him 
 (to praise Him) 
 And shout it while eternity rolls 
 Oh, He touched me 
 Oh, He touched me 
 He touched me 
 And all the joy that floods my soul 
 Something happened and now I know 
 He touched me and made me whole
