O come, all ye faithful 
 Joyful and triumphant 
 O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem 
 Come and behold Him 
 Born the King of Angels 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 Christ the Lord 
 Sing, choirs of angels 
 Sing in exaltation 
 Oh sing, all ye bright hosts 
 Of heaven above 
 Glory to God, Glory in the highest 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 Christ the Lord
