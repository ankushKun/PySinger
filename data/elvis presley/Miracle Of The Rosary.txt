Oh blessed mother we pray to thee 
 Thanks for the miracle of your rosary 
 Only you can hold back 
 Your holy son's hand 
 Long enough for the whole world to understand 
 Hail, Mary full of grace 
 The Lord is with thee 
 Blessed are thou among women 
 And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus 
 Oh holy Mary dear mother of God 
 Please pray for us sinners 
 Now and at the hour of our death 
 And give thanks once again 
 For the miracle of your rosary
