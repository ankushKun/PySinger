Lordy only believe 
 Only believe 
 All things are possible 
 If you'll only believe 
 My Lordy, only believe 
 Yes, only believe 
 All things are possible 
 If you'll only believe

 My soul feeling bad 
 Heart heavy-laden 
 I felt fire doubt ahead 
 Well He lifted all my burdens 
 Yeah, right now I'm feeling glad 
 All things are possible 
 If you'll only believe 
 I believe 
 Yeah, I believe 
 All things are possible 
 If you'll only believe
