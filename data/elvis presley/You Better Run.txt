(Well now you'd better run) 
 Run when I say, somebody's calling you 
 You'd better run 
 Run when I say, (somebody's calling you) 
 You'd better run 
 Run when I say, (somebody's calling you) 
 I feel like my time has long gone 
 Long gone, (my time is long gone) 
 Well now goodbye false pretender 
 Lord I cannot wait for you 
 For the bible declares you're goin' to heaven Lord 
 What the bible declares you do 
 (Well now you'd better run) 
 Run when I say, somebody's calling you 
 You'd better run 
 Run when I say, (somebody's calling you) 
 You'd better run 
 Run when I say, (somebody's calling you) 
 I feel like my time has long gone 
 Long gone, (my time is long gone) 
 Long gone 
 Well I met a false pretender 
 Whose head was bending Lord 
 I met him in the evening 
 He was headed down that long lonesome road 
 (Well now you'd better run) 
 Run when I say, somebody's calling you 
 You'd better run 
 Run when I say, (somebody's calling you) 
 You'd better run 
 Get away from here, somebody's calling you 
 I feel like my time has long gone 
 Long gone, (my time is long gone), long gone
