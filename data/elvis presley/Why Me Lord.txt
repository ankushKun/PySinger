(Why Me Lord? What have I ever done 
 To deserve even one 
 Of the pleasures I've known 
 Tell me Lord what did I ever do 
 To deserve loving you 
 And the kindness you've shown) 
 Lord heavenly Jesus I praise Him 
 So help me Jesus, I know what I am 
 Now that I know that I needed you so 
 Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hands 
 (Try me Lord, if you think there's a way 
 I can ever repay 
 All I've taken from you 
 Forgive Lord I can show someone else 
 What I've been through myself 
 On my way back to you) 
 Lord heavenly Jesus I praise Him 
 So help me Jesus I know what I am, oh yes 
 Now that I know that I needed you so 
 Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hands 
 Jesus my soul's in your hands
