Our Father, Who Art in Heaven 
 Hallowed be, Thy Name 
 Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be Done 
 On earth, as it is, in Heaven 
 Give us this day, our daily bread 
 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors 
 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil 
 For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory forever 
 Amen
