Lying by your side I watch you sleeping 
 And in your face the sweetness of a child 
 Murmuring the dream you won't recapture 
 Though it will haunt the corners of your mind 
 Oh, I've lost you though you're near me 
 And your body's still as kind 
 I've lost you on the journey 
 But I can't remember where or when 
 Oh no 
 Who can tell when summer turns to autumn 
 And who can point the moment love grows cold 
 Softly, without pain, the joy is over 
 Though why it's gone neither of us know 
 Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you 
 I can't reach you anymore 
 We ought to talk it over now 
 But reason can't stand in for feeling 
 Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you 
 I can't reach you anymore 
 We ought to talk it over now 
 But reason can't stand in for feeling 
 Six o'clock the baby will be crying 
 And you will stumble, sleeping, to the door 
 In the chill and sullen gray of morning 
 We play the parts that we have learned too well 
 Oh, I've lost you, oh I've lost you 
 Though you won't admit it so 
 I've lost you on the journey 
 But I can't remember where or whe 
 Oh no 
 Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you 
 I can't reach you anymore 
 We ought to talk it over now 
 But reason can't stand in for feeling
