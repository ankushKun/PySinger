Home is where the heart is 
 And my heart is anywhere you are 
 Anywhere you are is home 
 I don't need a mansion on a hill 
 That overlooks the sea 
 Anywhere you're with me is home 
 Maybe I'm a rolling stone 
 Who won't amount to much 
 But everything that I hold dear 
 Is close enough to touch 
 For home is where the heart is 
 And my heart is anywhere you are 
 Anywhere you are is home 
 Maybe I'm a rolling stone 
 Who won't amount to much 
 But everything that I hold dear 
 Is close enough to touch 
 For home is where the heart is 
 And my heart is anywhere you are 
 Anywhere you are is home 
 Home, home, home, home, home
