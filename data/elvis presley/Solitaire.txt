There was a man, a lonely man 
 Who lost his love, through his indifference 
 A heart that cared that went unshared 
 Until it died within his silence 
 And solitaire is the only game in town 
 And every road that takes him, takes him down 
 While life goes on around him everywhere 
 He's playing solitaire 
 And keeping to himself, begins to deal 
 And still the king of hearts is well concealed 
 Another losing games comes to an end 
 And deals them out again 
 A little hope goes up in smoke 
 Just how it goes, goes without saying 
 There was a man, a lonely man 
 Who would command the hand he's playing 
 And solitaire is the only game in town 
 And every road that takes him, takes him down 
 While life goes on around him everywhere 
 He's playing solitaire 
 And keeping to himself, begins to deal 
 And still the king of hearts is well concealed 
 Another losing games comes to an end 
 And deals them out again 
 And solitaire is the only game in town 
 And every road that takes him, takes him down 
 While life goes on around him everywhere 
 He's playing solitaire
