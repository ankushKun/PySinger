I don't need a lot of presents 
 To make my Christmas bright 
 I just need my baby's arms 
 Wound around me tight 
 Oh oh Santa hear my plea 
 Santa bring my baby back to me 
 The Christmas tree is ready 
 The candles all aglow 
 But with my baby far away 
 What good is mistletoe 
 Oh oh Santa, hear my plea 
 Santa bring my baby back to me 
 Please make these reindeer hurry 
 Well their time is drawing near 
 It sure won't seem like Christmas 
 Until my baby's here 
 Don't fill my sock with candy 
 No bright and shiny toy 
 You wanna make me happy 
 And fill my heart with joy 
 Then Santa, hear my plea 
 Santa bring my baby back to me 
 Please make these reindeer hurry 
 Well their time is drawing near 
 It sure won't seem like Christmas 
 Until my baby's here 
 Don't fill my sock with candy 
 No bright and shiny toy 
 You wanna make me happy 
 And fill my heart with joy 
 Then Santa, hear my plea 
 Santa bring my baby back to me 
 Then Santa, hear my plea 
 Santa bring my baby back to me
