Left a good job in the city 
 Workin' for the man every night and day 
 And I never lost one minute of sleeping 
 Worried about the way things might have been 
 A big wheel keeps on turnin' 
 Proud Mary keeps on burnin' 
 Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river 
 Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river 
 If you come down to the river 
 Betcha you're gonna find some people who live 
 You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money 
 People on the river are happy to give 
 I said a big wheel keeps on turnin' 
 Proud Mary keeps on burnin' 
 Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river 
 Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river 
 If you come down to the river 
 Betcha you're gonna find some people who live 
 You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money 
 People on the river are happy to give 
 I said a big wheel keeps on turnin' 
 Proud Mary keeps on burnin' 
 Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river 
 Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river
