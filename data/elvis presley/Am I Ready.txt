Am I ready? Can my heart be true? 
 Am I ready to fall in love with you? 
 One love, one girl, one dream shared by two 
 Am I ready to fall in love with you? 
 I have touched your lips and now I know 
 I would be a fool to let you go 
 Should I? Could I? How I wish I knew 
 Am I ready to fall in love with you 
 Should I? Could I? How I wish I knew 
 Am I ready to fall in love with you 
 Fall in love with you
