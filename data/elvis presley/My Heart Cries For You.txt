If you're in Arizona, I'll follow you 
 If you're in Albuquerque, I'll be there too 
 We'll have a little chance to start a-new 
 Because my love is endless for you 
 My heart cries for you 
 Sighs for you, dies for you 
 My arms long for you 
 Please come back to me 
 An unimportant quarrel 
 Is what we had 
 We have to learn to live with the good and bad 
 Come together da da da la dum... 
 This loneliness is driving me mad 
 My heart cries for you 
 Sighs for you, dies for you 
 My arms long for you 
 Please come back to me 
 My heart cries for you 
 Sighs for you, dies for you 
 My arms long for you 
 Please come back to me 
 Please come back, come back, come back to me
