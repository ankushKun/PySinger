I'll remember you 
 Long after this endless summer is gone 
 I'll be lonely, oh so lonely 
 Living only to remember you 
 I'll remember you 
 Your voice as soft 
 As the warm summer breeze 
 Your sweet laughter, mornings after 
 Ever after, I'll remember you 
 To your arms someday 
 I'll return to stay till then 
 I will remember too 
 Every bright star we made wishes upon 
 Love me always, promise always 
 Ooh, you'll remember too 
 To your arms someday 
 I'll return to stay till then 
 I will remember too 
 Every bright star we made wishes upon 
 Love me always, promise always 
 Ooh, you'll remember too 
 (I'll remember you) 
 I'll remember you
