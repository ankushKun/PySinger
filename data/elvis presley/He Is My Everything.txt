I long to be His possession 
 Oh, He is my everything 
 I remember my days of darkness 
 Without sunshine or sight to lead the way 
 But a whisper of his voice softly calling 
 To the arms of my maker to stay 
 He is my reason for living 
 Oh He is the king of all kings 
 I long to be His possession 
 Oh, He is my everything 
 After the lighting and thunder 
 After the last bell has rung 
 I want to bow down before him 
 And hear him say, 
 "Well done." 
 He is my reason for living 
 Oh, He is the king of all kings 
 I long to be His possession 
 Oh, He is my everything 
 I long to be His possession 
 Oh, He is my everything
