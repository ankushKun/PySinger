Who wants to buy a heart 
 One broken lover's heart 
 One broken heart for sale 
 Well, excuse me if you see me crying like a baby 
 Since she rejected me 
 There's nothing left to save me 
 Hey Cupid, where are you? 
 My heart is growing sadder 
 That girl rejected me 
 Just when I thought I had her 
 She would not listen to the things my heart was saying 
 She turned and walked away 
 And told me I was playing 
 Some guys have all the luck 
 And my heart hasn't any 
 I think I'll paint a sign 
 For sale for a penny
