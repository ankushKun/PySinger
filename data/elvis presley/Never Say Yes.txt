Look out now I'm runnin' wild 
 There ain't no holding back this child 
 I guess you'd say I'm a son of a gun 
 Livin' just for a life of fun 
 Here's the secret of my success 
 Never say yes, no, no, never say yes 
 Life has taught me one big lesson 
 Always keep the girlies guessin' 
 Tell 'em that you love them so 
 You hate to leave, but you gotta go 
 That's the secret of my success 
 Never say yes, no, no, never say yes 
 It's the oldest scheme in the world 
 And you gotta know how to play it 
 Tell her yes in so many ways 
 And never ever say it 
 That's how I keep goin' on 
 Here today, tomorrow gone 
 That's the kind of life for me 
 Being free like I want to be 
 Here's the secret of my success 
 Never say yes, no, no, never say yes 
 It's the oldest scheme in the world 
 And you gotta know how to play it 
 Tell her yes in so many ways 
 And never ever say it 
 That's how I keep goin' on 
 Here today, tomorrow gone 
 That's the kind of life for me 
 Being free like I want to be 
 Here's the secret of my success 
 Never say yes, no, no, never say yes 
 No, no, never say yes
