Take off your shoes, put down your hair 
 Turn on the music and we'll get somewhere 
 Dance, dance, dance, till nose gets tan 
 We're gonna have us a ball on the beach 
 A-slicin' sand 
 Hug me a heap, swing me a lot 
 We got a lot of ocean if it gets too hot 
 Ooh, ooh, baby, take my hand 
 We'll have some real rockin' fun in the sun 
 A-slicin' sand 
 Come baby, come, let's dig some holes 
 You'll find it's heaven with sand on you soles 
 Yeah! 
 Slide through to the left, slide to the right 
 Slash down the middle baby hold me tight 
 Ooh, ooh, baby, hold my hand 
 We'll have some real rockin' fun in the sun 
 Slicin' sand 
 We'll have some real rockin' fun in the sun 
 Slicin' sand
