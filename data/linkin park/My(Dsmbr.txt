This is My December 
 This is my time of the year... 
 This is My December 
 This is all so clear... 
 (Just wish that I didn't feel 
 Like there was something I missed...) 
 Like there was something I missed...) 
 This is My December 
 This is my snow-covered home... 
 This is My December 
 This is me alone... 
 And I... 
 (Just wish that I didn't feel 
 Like there was something I missed...) 
 And I... 
 (Take back all the things I said 
 To make you feel like that...) 
 And I... 
 (Just wish that I didn't feel 
 Like there was something I missed...) 
 And I... 
 (Take back the things I ever said to you...) 
 And I'd 
 Give it all away... 
 Just to have somewhere to go to 
 Give it all away... 
 To have someone to come home to... 
 This is My December 
 These are my snow-covered trees... 
 This is me pretending 
 This is all I need... 
 And I... 
 (Just wish that I didn't feel 
 Like there was something I missed...) 
 And I... 
 (Take back all the things I said 
 To make you feel like that...) 
 And I... 
 (Just wish that I didn't feel 
 Like there was something I missed...) 
 And I... 
 (Take back the things I ever said to you...) 
 And I'd 
 Give it all away... 
 Just to have somewhere to go to 
 Give it all away... 
 To have someone to come home to... 
 This is My December... 
 This is my time of the year... 
 This is My December... 
 This is all so clear!... 
 Give it all away... 
 Just to have somewhere to go to 
 Give it all away... 
 To have someone to come home to... 
 Give it all away... 
 Just to have somewhere to go to 
 Give it all away... 
 To have someone to come home to...
