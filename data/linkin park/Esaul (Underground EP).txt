Riding with the head full of buckets of red and what I said still stuck in my head 
 But misled thinking the things I'd do would make you never wanna come back 
 But when on front attacks, you could never run from that 
 Being trapped in this with you, something that I never wanted to do 
 But through it all you got to see 
 That where I want to be is over the pen again letting it out of me 
 In the centre of the day in a dream 
 Seeing all my thoughts getting lost in between 
 Realizing one, not the way that it seems 
 And the killing of the killer with a head full of screams 
 I want to live in another place where no one can say that I live for them 
 (Start seeing it's not meant to be for me) 
 I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy 
 A place for my head 
 And the second it starts, we're gonna be crushed when it all falls apart 
 Knowing no matter how low 
 Hoping that you won't know the strain it puts to me 
 Seeing what you've done and consequently 
 I've run away, just hidden again 
 Within the boundaries of an anguish 
 Don't want me to say this, but you're dragging me down 
 Lost in the chaos, being tossed around 
 Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic 
 Hope that someday you'll regret this 
 Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time 
 Adding to the panic of my confine 
 Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic 
 Hope that someday you'll regret this 
 Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time 
 Adding to the panic of my confine 
 I want to live in another place where no one can say that I live for them 
 (Start seeing it's not meant to be for me) 
 I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy 
 A place for my head 
 You try to take the best of me, go away... 
 You try to take the best of me, go away... 
 You try to take the best of me, go away... 
 You try to take the best of me, go away! 
 You try to take the best of me, go away! 
 You try to take the best of me, go away! 
 You try to take the best of me, go away! 
 You try to take the best of me, go away! 
 I want to live in another place where no one can say that I live for them 
 (Still I see it's not meant to be for me) 
 I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy 
 A place for my head 
 Take-a-way! 
 Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic 
 Hope that someday you'll regret this 
 Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time 
 Adding to the panic of my confine 
 Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic 
 Hope that someday you'll regret this 
 Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time 
 Adding to the panic of my confine
