God bless us, everyone 
 We're a broken people living under loaded gun 
 And it can't be outfought, it can't be outdone 
 It can't be outmatched, it can't be outrun, no 
 God bless us, everyone 
 We're a broken people living under loaded gun 
 And it can't be outfought, it can't be outdone 
 It can't be outmatched, it can't be outrun, no 
 And when I close my eyes tonight 
 To symphonies of blinding light 
 (God bless us, everyone) 
 (We're a broken people living under loaded gun) 
 Oh, like memories in cold decay 
 Transmissions echoing away 
 Far from the world of you and I 
 Where oceans bleed into the sky 
 God save us, everyone 
 Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns? 
 For the sins of our hand, the sins of our tongue 
 The sins of our father, the sins of our young, no 
 God save us, everyone 
 Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns? 
 For the sins of our hand, the sins of our tongue 
 The sins of our father, the sins of our young, no 
 And when I close my eyes tonight 
 To symphonies of blinding light 
 (God save us, everyone) 
 (Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?) 
 Oh, like memories in cold decay 
 Transmissions echoing away 
 Far from the world of you and I 
 Where oceans bleed into the sky 
 Oh, like memories in cold decay 
 Transmissions echoing away 
 Far from the world of you and I 
 Where oceans bleed into the sky
