Yo, yo 
 Forfeit the game, before somebody else 
 Takes you out of the frame, puts your name to shame 
 Cover up your face, you can't run the race 
 The pace is too fast, you just won't last 
 You love the way I look at you 
 While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through 
 You take away if I give in 
 My life, my pride is broken 
 You like to think you're never wrong (You like to think you're never wrong) 
 You have to act like you're someone (You have to act like you're someone) 
 You want someone to hurt like you (You want someone to hurt like you) 
 You want to share what you've been through 
 (You live what you've learned) 
 You love the things I say I'll do 
 The way I'll hurt myself again just to get back at you 
 You take away when I give in 
 My life, my pride is broken 
 You like to think you're never wrong (You like to think you're never wrong) 
 You have to act like you're someone (You have to act like you're someone) 
 You want someone to hurt like you (You want someone to hurt like you) 
 You want to share what you've been through 
 (You live what you've learned)
