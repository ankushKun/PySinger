Uh, yeah 
 Why does it feel like night today? 
 Something in here's not right today 
 Why am I so uptight today? 
 Paranoia's all I got left 
 I don't know what stressed me first 
 Or how the pressure was fed 
 But I know just what it feels like 
 To have a voice in the back of my head 
 Like a face that I hold inside 
 Face that awakes when I close my eyes 
 Face that I watch every time I lie 
 Face that laughs every time I fall 
 And watches everything 
 So I know that when it's time to sink or swim 
 That the face inside is hearing me right underneath my skin 
 It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back 
 It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
 It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
 It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
 Hey yo 
 Here we go again with the pain I feel 
 Is it real or in my mind? 
 When I found myself in places 
 With names but not faces 
 My memory races at speeds 
 Hundred degrees, my soul bleed 
 Devil must of planted the seed 
 Now it feels like my back's against the wall 
 I'm taking the fall 
 Whenever I call 
 Nobody's responding at all 
 But I don't know who I can trust 
 They screaming my name 
 I need somebody to help me out of the flame 
 All I'm trying to do is just master me 
 All I wanna do is smoke a blast a beat 
 But something keeps talking to me consciously 
 Responsibly, keeps haunting me 
 From dusk till dawn 
 Everything has something for ya 
 That voice inside of your head 
 Got to project it, paranoia 
 Cold sweat shining on your face 
 Exposing your purpose 
 And if I ripped off your skin 
 I'd probably find another person 
 There's nothing worse than trying to pull yourself up back from the dead 
 So I advise you, listen to that voice in the back of your head 
 It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back 
 It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
 It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
 It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
 The face inside is right beneath the skin 
 The sun goes down 
 I feel the light betray me 
 The sun goes down 
 It's like I'm paranoid 
 I feel the light betray me 
 The sun... 
 Can't stop what I'm hearing within 
 It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
 It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back 
 It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
 It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
 It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
