Skin to bone, steel to rust 
 Ash to ashes, dust to dust 
 Will tomorrow have it's way with the promises we made? 
 Skin to bone, steel to rust 
 Ash to ashes, dust to dust 
 Your deception, my disgust 
 When your name is finally drawn, I’ll be happy that you’re gone 
 Ash to ashes, dust to dust 
 Uh-uh-uh 
 Ash to ashes, dust to dust 
 Uh-uh-uh 
 Skin to bone and steel to rust 
 Right to left, left to right 
 Night to day and day to night 
 As the starlight fades to grey, I’ll be marching far away 
 Right to left and left to right 
 Uh-uh-uh 
 Ash to ashes, dust to dust 
 Uh-uh-uh 
 Skin to bone and steel to rust 
 Let tomorrow have it's ways with the promises betrayed 
 Skin to bone and steel to rust 
 Skin to bone and steel to rust 
 Skin to bone and steel to rust
