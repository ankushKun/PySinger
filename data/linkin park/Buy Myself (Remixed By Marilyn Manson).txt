What do I do to ignore them behind me? 
 Do I follow my instincts blindly? 
 Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams 
 And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening? Do I 
 Sit here and try to stand it, or do I 
 Try to catch them red-handed? 
 Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness, 
 Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness? 
 Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin, 
 I make the right moves but I'm lost within. 
 I put on my daily facade, but then 
 I just end up getting hurt again. 
 By myself (myself) 
 I ask, why (myself) 
 I can't rely on myself (myself) 
 I ask, why 
 But in my mind I find 
 I can't rely on myself 
 I can't hold on 
 (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin) 
 It's all too much to take in 
 I can't hold on 
 (To anything watching everything spin) 
 With thoughts of failure sinking in. 
 If I turn my back, I'm senseless, 
 But to go blindly seems defenseless, 
 If I hide my pride and let it all go on, 
 Then they'll take from me till everything is gone, if I 
 Let them go, I'll be outrun, but if I 
 Try to catch them, I'll be outdone. 
 If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer, 
 Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer 
 By myself (myself)

 I can't rely on myself (myself) 
 I ask, why 
 But in my mind I find 
 I can't rely on myself

 How do you think, 
 I've lost so much? 
 I'm so afraid (I'm so afraid) 
 I'm so afraid (I'm so afraid) 
 I'm out of touch (just nice to know...) 
 How you suspect (how you suspect) 
 I will know what to do, 
 When all I know 
 Is what you tell me to? 
 Don't you (know) 
 I can't tell you how to make it (go) 
 No matter what I do, how hard I (try) 
 I can't seem to convince myself (why) 
 I'm stuck on the inside. 
 Don't you (know) 
 I can't tell you how to make it (go) 
 No matter what I do, how hard I (try) 
 I can't seem to convince myself (why) 
 I'm stuck on the other side 
 I can't hold on 
 (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin) 
 It's all too much to take in 
 I can't hold on 
 (To anything watching everything spin) 
 With thoughts of failure sinking in. 
 I can't hold on 
 (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin) 
 It's all too much to take in 
 I can't hold on
