A fire needs a space to burn, a breath to build a glow 
 I've heard it said a thousand times, but now I know 
 That you don't know what you've got 
 Oh, you don't know what you've got 
 No, you don't know what you've got until it's gone 
 Until it's gone 
 Until it's gone 
 I thought I kept you safe and sound, I thought I made you strong 
 But something made me realize that I was wrong 
 'Cause finding what you've got sometimes means finding it alone 
 And I can finally see your light when I let go 
 'Cause you don't know what you've got till it's gone 
 Until it's gone 
 Until it's gone 
 Until it's gone 
 Until it's gone 
 Until it's gone 
 Until it's gone 
 Until it's gone 
 'Cause you don't know what you've got 
 Oh, you don't know what you've got 
 No, you don't know what you've got 
 It's your battle to be fought 
 No you don't know what you've got till it's gone 
 Till it's gone 
 Till it's gone
