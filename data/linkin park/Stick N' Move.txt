This is how it's done, going for the title and crown 
 Renowned emcees surround as the beat breaks down 
 In two elements, clobbin' up those that bring the best 
 And as the M-I seek the way it ought to be ponnessed 
 Yes, yes am I the one to keep you on your toes? 
 Most definitely in my b-boy pose 
 The, uh, electric boogaloo with a slight twist 
 Touch your chin to your chest to the rhythm like this 
 Now see what I have, I want you 
 Be with me or stick n' move 
 Now see what I had, I want you 
 Be with me or stick n' move 
 MC's dogging me since the first day I grabbed the mic 
 Now it's like "You sit! You stay!" 
 Cobra path lifestyles, I'm kicking 
 Sticking emcees real quick 'cause times ticking 
 At the drop of the defence, I let loose a venom 
 Sending a shot of verbal heat up in 'em 
 The ending is done, grab your family and run 
 Apocalyptic rhyme pattern taking shots at the sun 
 Record industry rule four-thousand-eighty-one: 
 Question my intentions and your whole world is done 
 Like Forrest you'll run, turn your eyeballs into Saturn 
 Full metal jacket fully auto-rhyme pattern 
 Now see what I have, I want you 
 Be with me or stick n' move 
 Now see what I had, I want you 
 Be with me or stick n' move 
 Stick it, rock it for a click and I'm wicked 
 Moving, moving all my tunes and you groove it 
 Stick it, rock it for a click and I'm wicked 
 Moving, moving all my tunes and you groove it 
 Stick it, rock it for a click and I'm wicked (Uh!) 
 Moving, moving all my tunes and you groove it 
 Stick it, rock it for a click and I'm wicked 
 Moving, moving all my tunes and you groove it 
 Now see what I have, I want you 
 Be with me or stick n' move 
 Now see what I had, I want you 
 Be with me or stick n' move
