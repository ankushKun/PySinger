Yo (yo) 
 Watch as the room rocks, mentally moonwalk 
 Mixed media slang banging in your boom-box 
 Verbal violence, lyrical stylist 
 In a time when rock/hip-hop rhymes are childish 
 You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty 
 Rapping to a beat doesn't make you an emcee 
 With your lack of skill and facility, you're killing me 
 And a DJ in the group just for credibility 
 I heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes 
 You're not an emcee if someone else writes your lines 
 Rapping over rock doesn't make you a pioneer 
 'Cause rock and hip-hop have collaborated for years 
 But now they're getting randomly mixed-and-matched up 
 All after a fast buck, and all the tracks suck 
 So how does it stack up? None of it's real 
 You wanna be an emcee? You've got to study the skill 
 Who can rock a rhyme like this? 
 Bring it to you every time like this? 
 Who can rock a rhyme like this? 
 Step, step up, step, step up 
 So you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity 
 But mentally you don't have the hip-hop energy 
 With a tendency to make up stories 
 It sounded like the only hip-hop you heard was Top 40 (Top 40) 
 And your record company's completely missing it 
 And all the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate 
 So in a battle you can't hack it 
 React with whack shit 
 And get smacked with verbal backflips 
 Get your ass kicked with a fabulous battle catalyst 
 It's taken decades for emcees to establish this 
 You're new to hip-hop, and welcome if your serious 
 But not on the mic - leave that to the experienced 
 (Using waves of sound, the true master paralyzes his opponent, leaving him vulnerable to attack.)

 (After years of painstaking research, by the worlds leading sound scientists. We here at the Sound Institute have invented a reliable "Audio Weapon System". Actual movement of musical sound in space is used to carefully attack and utilize the cellular structure of the human body, so the question must be asked:)
