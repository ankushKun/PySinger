I'm dancing with my demons 
 I'm hanging off the edge 
 Storm clouds gather beneath me 
 Waves break above my head 
 Head-first hallucination 
 I wanna fall wide awake now 
 You tell me it's alright 
 Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight 
 But nobody can save me now 
 I'm holding up a light 
 Chasing up the darkness inside 
 'Cause nobody can save me 
 Stared into this illusion 
 For answers yet to come 
 I chose a false solution 
 But nobody proved me wrong 
 Head-first hallucination 
 I wanna fall wide awake 
 Watch the ground giving way now 
 You tell me it's alright 
 Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight 
 But nobody can save me now 
 I'm holding up a light 
 I'm chasing up the darkness inside 
 'Cause nobody can save me 
 Been searching somewhere out there 
 For what's been missing right here (I wanna fall wide awake now) 
 Been searching somewhere out there 
 For what's been missing right here 
 I wanna fall wide awake now 
 So tell me it's alright 
 Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight 
 And only I can save me now 
 I'm holding up a light 
 Chasing up the darkness inside 
 And I don't wanna let you down 
 But only I can save me! 
 Been searching somewhere out there 
 For what's been missing right here.
