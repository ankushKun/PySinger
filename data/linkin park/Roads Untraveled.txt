Weep not for roads untravelled 
 Weep not for paths left alone 
 'Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end 
 It's the worst kind of pain I've known 
 Give up your heart left broken and let that mistake pass on 
 'Cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost 
 And in time you'll be glad it's gone 
 Weep not for roads untraveled 
 Weep not for sights unseen 
 May your love never end, and if you need a friend 
 There's a seat here alongside me
