Today 
 We stood on the wall 
 We laughed at the sun 
 We laughed at the guns 
 We laughed at it all 
 And when they 
 They told us to go 
 We paid them no mind 
 Like every other time 
 But little did we know 
 Today 
 I looked for a sign 
 With flames in my hands 
 A line in the sand 
 Between yours and mine 
 And it came 
 Like fire from below 
 Your greed led the call 
 My flag had to fall 
 But little did you know 
 Another day, your truth will come 
 You're gonna pay for what you've 
 Pay for what you've done 
 You'll get what's yours and face your crime 
 You'll tell them, give me back what's mine 
 Give me back what's mine 
 I had never been a coward 
 I had never seen blood 
 You had sold me an ocean 
 And I was lost in the flood 
 We were counting on a leader 
 And we were driven by need 
 But couldn't take temptation 
 And we were blinded by greed 
 You were steady as a sniper 
 We were waiting on a wire 
 So we never saw it coming 
 When you ran from the fire 
 You can try intimidation 
 You can try to ignore 
 But when the time comes calling 
 Yeah, you are gonna get yours 
 Another day, your truth will come 
 You're gonna pay for what you've 
 Pay for what you've done 
 You'll get what's yours and face your crime 
 You'll tell them, give me back what's mine 
 Give me back what's mine 
 And so today, your truth has come 
 You're gonna pay for what you've 
 Pay for what you've done 
 You'll get what's yours, you're out of time 
 And you will give me back what's mine 
 Give me back what's mine 
 Give me, give me back what's mine 
 Give me, give me back what's mine 
 What's mine 
 Give me, give me back what's mine 
 What's mine 
 What's mine 
 Give me back what's mine 
 Today

 We laughed at it all
