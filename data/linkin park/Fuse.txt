"Of course you know what a fuse is... 
 It's a long piece of cord impregnated with gun powder. 
 When you strike a match and light it 
 It burns, fitfully, spiraling to its end 
 At which there is, a little surprise..." 
 From the planet of Krypton 
 Insuring suit emcees you'll be ripped on (ripped on) 
 You fell off and it's my lyric sheet you slipped on 
 Get gone, spit on mic's made in Hong Kong 
 Rock on, sing songs, we're mightier than King Kong 
 Or Donkey Kong, you think you want me? Or want this? 
 You want some? Hold your reputation for ransom 
 With these here, handsomely crafted tactics 
 To break a snake emcee like a cheap prophylactic 
 Galactic, spaced-out gab that grabs attention 
 Crack-heads nodded like a past can't even mention 
 Ride on patch traps, gas tracks and sections 
 Kid's ethnicity, witness protection 
 Trying to see what I can't be seeing 
 I'll be here 
 Trying to see what I can't be seeing 
 I'll be here 
 Yo, dig this, dig this 
 Yo, it's the junkyard crooked letter-C-I-EN-tific 
 Duck us, the ruckus I'll bring stings your eardrum 
 Hear one, 'la 'la let loose, find me fearsome 
 Opposing troops on my home front shall be gone 
 Testing the eight-hundred-eighteenth battalion 
 Shall I go on? Crews run like rebels 
 Enola Gay rhymes kick the notch up a level in intensity 
 Send back attacks that you sent to me 
 Blow up your spot with grenades that were meant for me 
 MP3 verses on R-33 emcees 
 Swiss cheese your gear putting shrapnel in the breeze 
 I lead emcees with enemy companies 
 With my hand full of lyrics, talking 'bout "you want these?" 
 Please, don't even speak the name of channels 
 And go low-gadget mic shit, put it down like pens 
 For my friends and my fam' 
 Better dodge or I'll ram this mic shot through the back of an emcee's hand 
 With the strength of He-Man 
 I'll bet you don't want that 
 Close-bodies filled fields in hand-to-hand combat 
 Battle cats, it's like the sectional speech 
 Warfare words slashin' at cords 
 Compete for a name, lyrical shots get lit 
 Don't question my intention when your butt gets kicked 
 Trying to see what I can't be seeing 
 I'll be here 
 (Teflon metallic syllaballic attacks) 
 Trying to see what I can't be seeing 
 I'll be here 
 (We'll haunt MC's with these lyrical back smacks) 
 (Go ahead, suit yourself) 
 Why 
 Why wait, I shouldn't have told you so 
 Why wait, I shouldn't have told you so 
 Why wait, I shouldn't have told you so 
 Why wait, I shouldn't have told you so (Why?) 
 Why wait, I shouldn't have told you so 
 Why wait, I shouldn't have told you so 
 Why wait, I shouldn't have told you so 
 Why wait, I shouldn't have told you so 
 Trying to see what I can't be seeing 
 I'll be here 
 (Teflon metallic syllaballic attacks) 
 Trying to see what I can't be seeing 
 I'll be here
