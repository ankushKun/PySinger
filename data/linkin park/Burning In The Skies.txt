I used the dead wood to make the fire rise 
 The blood of innocents burning in the skies 
 I filled my cup with the risin' of the sea 
 And poured it out in an ocean of debris 
 Oh, I'm swimming in the smoke of bridges I have burned 
 So don't apologize, I'm losing what I don't deserve 
 What I don't deserve 
 We held our breath when the clouds began to form 
 But you were lost in the beating of the storm 
 But in the end, we were made to be apart 
 Like separate chambers of the human heart 
 No, I'm swimming in the smoke of bridges I have burned 
 So don't apologize, I'm losing what I don't deserve 
 It's in the blackened bones of bridges I have burned 
 So don't apologize, I'm losing what I don't deserve 
 What I don't deserve 
 I'm swimming in the smoke of bridges I have burned 
 So don't apologize, I'm losing what I don't deserve 
 The blame is mine alone for bridges I have burned 
 So don't apologize, I'm losing what I don't deserve 
 What I don't deserve 
 What I don't deserve, oh 
 What I don't deserve 
 I used the dead wood to make the fire rise 
 The blood of innocents burning in the skies
