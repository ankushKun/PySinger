Myself 
 Myself 
 What do I do to ignore them behind me? 
 Do I follow my instincts blindly? 
 Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams 
 And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening? 
 Do I sit here and try to stand it? 
 Or do I try to catch them red-handed? 
 Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness 
 Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness? 
 Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin 
 I make the right moves but I'm lost within 
 I put on my daily facade but then 
 I just end up getting hurt again 
 By myself (myself) 
 I ask why 
 But in my mind I find 
 I can't rely on myself (myself) 
 I ask why 
 But in my mind I find 
 I can't rely on myself 
 I can't look around 
 (It's too much to take in) 
 I can't hold on 
 (When I'm stretched so thin) 
 I can't slow down 
 (Watching everything spin) 
 I can't look back 
 (It's starting over again) 
 If I turn my back I'm defenseless 
 And to go blindly seems senseless 
 If I hide my pride and let it all go on 
 Then they'll take from me till everything is gone 
 If I let them go I'll be outdone 
 But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun 
 If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer 
 Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer 
 By myself (myself) 
 I ask why 
 But in my mind I find 
 I can't rely on myself (myself) 
 I ask why 
 But in my mind I find 
 I can't rely on myself 
 I can't look around 
 (It's too much to take in) 
 I can't hold on 
 (When I'm stretched so thin) 
 I can't slow down 
 (Watching everything spin) 
 I can't look back

 No mater what I do, how hard I (try) 
 I can't seem to convince myself (why)
