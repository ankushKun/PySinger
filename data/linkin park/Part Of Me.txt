Part of me won't go away 
 Everyday reminded how much I hate it 
 Weighted against the consequences 
 Can't live without it so it's senseless 
 Wanna cut it out of my soul 
 And just live with a gaping hole 
 Take control of my life 
 And wash out all the burnt taste 
 I made the problems in the first place 
 Hang my head low cause it's part of me 
 You hardly see right next to the heart of me 
 Hurting me, the routine scar 
 New cuts cover where the old ones are 
 And I'm sick of this 
 I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity 
 I rather not even be better then the man that's staring in the mirror through me 
 Cut myself free willingly 
 Stop just what's killing me 
 Cut myself free willingly 
 Stop just what's killing me 
 Cut myself free willingly 
 Stop just what's killing me 
 Cut myself free willingly 
 Stop just what's killing me 
 I feel it every day 
 I feel I'm in my way 
 I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside 
 Swallowing me 
 (Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it) 
 Once it's been dealt with you 
 Feel like you've been touched by something angelic 
 And then melted down into a pool of peace 
 Cease to be the animal you used to be 
 Remove the broken parts you know were wrong 
 And feel the calm when the problem's all gone 
 And then you start to see another piece of yourself 
 That you can't let be 
 And memories of the last fight to free yourself 
 Take it to the depths of the bottom of the well 
 And now you know you can choose 
 To lose the part in your heart 
 Where your insides bruise 
 You can live if you're willing to 
 Put a stop to just what's killing you 
 Cut myself free willingly 
 Stop just what's killing me 
 Cut myself free willingly 
 Stop just what's killing me 
 Cut myself free willingly 
 Stop just what's killing me 
 Cut myself free willingly 
 Stop just what's killing me 
 I feel it every day 
 I feel I'm in my way 
 I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside 
 Swallowing me 
 (Alive in me, inside of me, a part of me screams away silently) 
 (Alive in me, inside of me, a part of me screams away silently) 
 This part of me won't go away! Part of me won't go away! 
 (Alive in me, inside of me, a part of me screams away silently) 
 Part of me won't go away! part of me won't go away! 
 (Alive in me, inside of me, a part of me screams away silently) 
 Everywhere I look around I see how everything ought to be 
 Every time I see myself there's always something wrong with me 
 Everywhere I look around I see how everything ought to be 
 Every time I see myself there's always something wrong with me 
 I feel it every day 
 I feel I'm in my way 
 I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside 
 Swallowing me 
 I feel it every day 
 I feel I'm in my way 
 I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside 
 Swallowing me 
 I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside, swallowing me! 
 I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside, swallowing me!
