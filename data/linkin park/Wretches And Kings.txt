There's a time 
 When the operation of the machine 
 Becomes so odious 
 Makes you so sick at heart 
 That you can't take part 
 You can't even passively take part 
 And you've got to put your bodies 
 Upon the gears and upon the wheels 
 Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus 
 And you've got to make it stop 
 To save face, how low can you go? 
 Talk a lot of game, but yet, you don't know 
 Static on the way, make us all say whoa 
 The people up top push the people down low 
 Get down, and obey every word 
 Steady, get in line if you haven't yet heard 
 Wanna take what I got? Don't be absurd 
 Don't fight the power, nobody gets hurt 
 If you haven't heard yet, then I'm lettin' you know 
 There ain't shit we don't run when the guns unload 
 And no one make a move 'less my people say so 
 Got everything outta control, now everybody go 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Steel unload, final blow 
 We, the animals, take control 
 Hear us now, clear and true 
 Wretches and kings, we come for you 
 So keep pace, how slow can you go? 
 Talk a lot of shit, and yet, you don't know 
 Fire on the way, make you all say whoa 
 The people up top and the people down low 
 Get down, and I'm runnin' it like that 
 The front of the attack is exactly where I'm at 
 Somewhere in-between the kick and the hi-hat 
 The pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact 
 So get with the combat, I'm lettin' 'em know 
 There ain't shit you can say to make me back down, no 
 So, push the button, let the whole thing blow 
 Spinnin' everything outta control, now everybody go 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Steel unload, final blow 
 We, the animals, take control 
 Hear us now, clear and true 
 Wretches and kings, we come for you 
 Steel unload, fire blow 
 Filthy animals, beat them low 
 Skin and bone, black and blue 
 No more this sun shall beat onto you 
 From the front to the back and the side-to-side 
 If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high 
 Front to the back and the side-to-side 
 If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high 
 Front to the back and the side-to-side 
 If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high 
 Front to the back and the side-to-side 
 If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high 
 Front to the back and the side-to-side 
 If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high 
 Front to the back and the side-to-side 
 If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high 
 When the operation of the machine 
 Becomes so odious 
 Makes you so sick at heart 
 That you can't take part 
 You can't even passively take part 
 And you've got to put your bodies 
 Upon the gears and upon the wheels 
 Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus 
 And you've got to make it stop 
 And you've got to indicate to the people 
 Who run it, to the people who own it 
 That unless you're free, the machine 
 Will be prevented from working at all
