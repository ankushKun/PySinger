In these promises broken, deep below 
 Each word gets lost in the echo 
 So one last lie I can see through 
 This time I've finally let you 
 Go, go, go 
 Finally let you go 
 This time I've finally let you 
 Test my will, test my heart 
 Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up 
 Y'all go hard, I go smart 
 How's that working out for y'all in the back, huh? 
 I've seen that frustration 
 Been crossed and lost and told no 
 And I've come back unshaken 
 Let down and lived and let go 
 So you can let it be known 
 I don't hold back, I hold my own 
 I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned 
 I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone 
 I can't fall back, I came too far 
 Haul myself up and learn my scars 
 Let the bells ring wherever they are 
 'Cause I was there saying

 This time I've 
 This time I've

 This time I've finally let you go 
 This time I've finally let you (go) 
 G-go 
 Go
