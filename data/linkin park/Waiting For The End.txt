Yeah, yo 
 This is not the end, this is not the beginning 
 Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision 
 But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm 
 And though the words sound steady, something empty's within 'em 
 We say "Yeah", with fists flying up in the air 
 Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there 
 'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear 
 Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear 
 (yeah) 
 Waiting for the end to come, wishing I had strength to stand 
 This is not what I had planned, it's out of my control 
 Flying at the speed of light, thoughts were spinning in my head 
 So many things were left unsaid, it's hard to let you go 
 I know what it takes to move on 
 I know how it feels to lie 
 All I wanna do is trade this life for something new 
 Holding on to what I haven't got 
 Sitting in an empty room, trying to forget the past 
 This was never meant to last, I wish it wasn't so 
 I know what it takes to move on 
 I know how it feels to lie 
 All I wanna do is trade this life for something new 
 Holding on to what I haven't got 
 Yo, yeah 
 What was left when that fire was gone? 
 I thought it felt right but that right was wrong 
 All caught up in the eye of the storm 
 I'm trying to figure out what it's like moving on 
 And I don't even know what kind of things I said 
 My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead 
 So, picking up the pieces now, where to begin? 
 The hardest part of ending is starting again 
 All I wanna do is trade this life for something new 
 Holding on to what I haven't got 
 This is not the end, this is not the beginning 
 Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision 
 (I'm holding on to what I haven't got) 
 But you listen to the tone and the violet rhythm 
 Though the words sound steady, something empty's within 'em 
 We say "Yeah", with fists flying up in the air 
 Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there 
 (Holding on to what I haven't got) 
 'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear 
 Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear
