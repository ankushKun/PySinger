One, two, one, two, thank you! 
 There’s no peace, only war 
 Victory decides who's wrong or right 
 It will not cease, only grow 
 You better be prepared to fight 
 And it will not apologize 
 For laying down your life 
 War 
 There's no pain it will spare 
 Fear has become your only right 
 And once you’re lost in your despair 
 Forever black eternal night 
 And it will not apologize 
 For laying down your life 
 War 
 Destroyer 
 War 
 Destroyer 
 It needs no side to justify 
 Laying down your life 
 War 
 Destroyer 
 War
