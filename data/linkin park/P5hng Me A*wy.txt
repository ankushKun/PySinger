When I look into your eyes, there's nothing there to see 
 Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me... 
 I've lied to you... 
 This is the last smile that I'll fake for the sake of being with you 
 Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down 
 Everything has to end, you'll soon find 
 (For the sake of being with you) 
 We're out of time left to watch it all unwind 
 Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down 
 The sacrifice is never knowing... 
 Why I stay when you just push away 
 No matter what you see, you're still so blind to me 
 I've tried like you, to do everything you wanted to 
 This is the last time, I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you! 
 Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down 
 The sacrifice of hiding in a lie 
 Everything has to end, you'll soon find 
 We're out of time left to watch it all unwind 
 The sacrifice is never knowing... 
 Why I stay when you just push away 
 No matter what you see, you're still so blind to me 
 Reverse psychology's failing miserably 
 It's so hard to be left all alone 
 Telling you is the only chance for me 
 There's nothing left but to turn and face you 
 When I look into your eyes, there's nothing there to see 
 Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me, asking why... 
 The sacrifice of hiding in a lie, the sacrifice is never knowing 
 Why I stay when you just push away 
 No matter what you see, you're still so blind to me 
 Why I stay when you just push away 
 No matter what you see, you're still so blind to me
