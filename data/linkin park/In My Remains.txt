Separate 
 Sifting through the wreckage, I can't concentrate 
 Searching for a message in the fear and pain 
 Broken down and waiting for the chance to feel alive 
 Now in my remains are promises that never came 
 Set this silence free to wash away the worst of me 
 Come apart 
 Falling in the cracks of every broken heart 
 Digging through the wreckage of your disregard 
 Sinking down and waiting for a chance to feel alive 
 Now in my remains are promises that never came 
 Set this silence free to wash away the worst of me 
 Like an army, falling one by one by one 
 Like an army, falling one by one by one 
 Like an army, falling one by one by one 
 Like an army, falling one by one by one 
 Now in my remains are promises that never came 
 Set this silence free to wash away the worst of me 
 Like an army, falling one by one by one 
 Like an army, falling one by one by one
