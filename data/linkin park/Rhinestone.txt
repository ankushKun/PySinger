From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop) 
 At the core of the rotten (Stopping just what I thought) 
 But sun has escaped us (So I'm bright in the sky) 
 And I'm far from awakeness (Thinking why did I try?) 
 From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop) 
 At the core of the rotten (Stopping just what I thought) 
 But sun has escaped us (So I'm bright in the sky) 
 And I'm far from awakeness (Thinking why did I try?) 
 From the thread to the needle, middle to end 
 When skies cock back and shock that which couldn't defend 
 The rain then sends dripping innocent question 
 Forcefully, the power of suggestion 
 Then, with the eyes tightly shut 
 Looking through the rust and rotten dust 
 A spot of light floods the floor 
 Pours itself upon the world of pretend 
 Then the eyes ease open and it's dark again 
 From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop) 
 At the core of the rotten (Stopping just what I thought) 
 But sun has escaped us (So I'm bright in the sky) 
 And I'm far from awakeness (Thinking why did I try?) 
 From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop) 
 At the core of the rotten (Stopping just what I thought) 
 But sun has escaped us (So I'm bright in the sky) 
 And I'm far from awakeness (Thinking why did I try?) 
 In a minute you'll find me 
 Eyes burning up 
 You say you'll never forget me 
 But the lies have piled up 
 Moving all around, screaming of the ups and downs 
 Pollution manifested in perpetual sound 
 And as the wheels go 'round, the sunset creeps past the 
 Street lamps, cars, chain-links, and concrete 
 A window then grows and captures the eye 
 And cries out yellow light as it passes it by 
 A small black figure sits in front of a box 
 Inside a box of rock with the needles on top 
 Nothing stops in this land of the chain 
 The brains lose not knowing they were part of the game 
 And then the insides go, but the box stays the same and shame 
 Shovel up the pieces to the pain 
 You can try to hide yourself in the world of pretend 
 But when the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again 
 From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop) 
 At the core of the rotten (Stopping just what I thought) 
 But sun has escaped us (So I'm bright in the sky) 
 And I'm far from awakeness (Thinking why did I try?) 
 From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop) 
 At the core of the rotten (Stopping just what I thought) 
 But sun has escaped us (So I'm bright in the sky) 
 And I'm far from awakeness (Thinking why did I try?) 
 In a minute you'll find me 
 Eyes burn me up 
 You say you'll never forget me 
 But the lies have piled up 
 Yeah I got you caught in the act 
 You better step back 
 Telling me that I'm seeing right through you 
 Yeah I got you caught in the act 
 You better step back 
 Telling me that I'm seeing right through you 
 Yeah I got you caught in the act 
 You better step back 
 Telling me that I'm seeing right through you 
 Yeah I got you caught in the act 
 You better step back 
 Telling me that I'm seeing right through you 
 Yeah I got you caught in the act 
 You better step back 
 Telling me that I'm seeing right through you 
 Yeah I got you caught in the act 
 You better step back 
 Telling me that I'm seeing right through you 
 Yeah I got you caught in the act 
 You better step back 
 Telling me that I'm seeing right through you 
 Yeah I got you caught in the act 
 You better step back 
 Telling me that I'm seeing right through you 
 In a minute you'll find me 
 Eyes burn me up 
 You say you'll never forget me 
 But the lies have piled up 
 In a minute you'll find me... 
 Eyes burn me up... 
 You say you'll never forget me... 
 But the lies keep piling up...
