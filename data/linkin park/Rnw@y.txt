Graffiti skies, skies...(echo fade) 
 I don't think y'all ready 
 Yo, I don't think y'all ready 
 Graffiti decorations under a sky of gray 
 This constant apprehension still giving me away 
 The lessons I've forgotten 
 In spite of all I've learned 
 Now I find myself in question 
 (Point, point the finger at me again) 
 Guilty by association 
 (Point, point the finger at me again) 
 I wanna runaway 
 (I wanna runaway) 
 I wanna know the truth 
 (I wanna know the truth) 
 I wanna know the answers 
 (I wanna know the answers) 
 I wanna shut the door 
 (And open up my mind) 
 And open up my mind 
 (And open up my mind) 
 Paper bags and angry voices under a sky of gray 
 This constant apprehension won't seem to go away 
 All my talk of starting over 
 These words were never true 
 Now I find myself in question 
 (Point, point the finger at me again) 
 I'm guilty by association 
 (Point, point the finger at me again) 
 I wanna runaway 
 (I wanna runaway) 
 I wanna know the truth 
 (I wanna know the truth) 
 I wanna know the answers 
 (I wanna know the answers) 
 I wanna shut the door 
 (And open up my mind) 
 And open up my mind 
 (And open up my mind) 
 Gonna runaway, gonna runaway 
 Gonna runaway, gonna runaway 
 Runaway (being scratched over and over again) 
 (Y'all not ready) 
 Hey yo 
 I don't think y'all ready for what I'm about to do 
 Y'all new school dudes ain't even got no clue 
 How dare you forget about Bam and Zulu 
 Two urban jazz DJ's they paved the way 
 Let me spit it to y'all who said I wasn't gonna make it 
 Every time I blaze it, y'all the first to hate it 
 My team reins supreme and stays strong 
 Every 2 series son, they scared to put us on 
 Can't get with the high prince, get off your high atis 
 Too many of y'all is dyin' for us so I gotta blaze it 
 I'm still reppin BK, Brooklyn D and on 
 Hell fire and family alienation 
 Banging hits in the backyard 
 Out on the episode 
 I'm a little kid named 
 Phoenix Orion 
 I wanna runaway 
 (I wanna runaway) 
 I wanna know the truth 
 (I wanna know the truth) 
 I wanna know the answers 
 (I wanna know the answers) 
 I wanna shut the door 
 (And open up my mind) 
 And open up my mind 
 (And open up my mind)
