(I'm about to break 
 I need a little room to breathe 
 'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge 
 And I'm about to break) 
 (I'm about to break 
 Where's my room to breathe 
 Where's my room to breathe 
 This room to breathe) 
 I cannot take this anymore 
 Saying everything I've said before 
 All these words, they make no sense 
 I found bliss in ignorance 
 Less I hear, the less you say 
 You'll find that out anyway 
 I find the answers aren't so clear 
 Wish I could find a way to disappear 
 All these thoughts, they make no sense 
 I found bliss in ignorance 
 Nothing seems to go away 
 Over and over again, over and over again 
 Over and over again, over and over again 
 Over and over again 
 Just like before, like before 
 Like before, like before 
 Like before 
 Everything you say to me 
 And I'm about to break 
 I need a little room to breathe 
 I'm about to break 
 Everything you say to me 
 And I'm about to break 
 I need a little room to breathe 
 And I'm about to (break) 
 These are the places where I can't feel 
 Torn from my body, my flesh it heals 
 During this ride we can cut up what we like (I'm about to break) 
 Waiting alone I can not resist 
 Feeling this hate I have never missed 
 Please someone give me a reason to rip off my face 
 Blood is a-pouring and pouring and pouring... 
 Shut up when I'm talking to you 
 Shut up 
 (Blood is pouring) 
 Shut up 
 (Blood is pouring) 
 Shut up 
 (Blood is pouring) 
 Shut up when I'm talking to you 
 Shut up 
 (Blood is pouring) 
 Shut up 
 (Blood is pouring) 
 Shut up 
 (Blood is pouring) 
 Shut up, I'm about to break 
 Everything you say to me 
 I'm about to break 
 I need a little room to breathe 
 I'm about to break 
 Everything you say to me 
 And I'm about to break 
 I need a little room to breathe 
 And I'm about to 
 Everything you say to me 
 Takes me one step closer to the edge 
 And I'm about to break 
 I need a little room to breathe 
 'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge 
 I'm about to break 
 Everything you say to me 
 Takes me one step closer to the edge 
 And I'm about to break 
 I need a little room to breathe 
 'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge 
 And I'm about to-
