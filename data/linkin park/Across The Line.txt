In this desert, in darkness 
 Lying with the gun across his chest 
 Pretending he's heartless 
 As the fire flashes in the sky 
 He was fragile and frozen 
 When the bullet took away his friend 
 And now he's somehow more broken 
 He's pulling his weapon to his side 
 Loading it full of his goodbyes 
 Holding an enemy across the line 
 He's pulling his weapon to his side 
 Loading it full of his goodbyes 
 Holding an enemy across the line 
 Sweating and shaking 
 Lying with her hands across her chest 
 She wakes with her cravings 
 As the fire flashes in her eye 
 She was fragile and frozen 
 When the needle took away her friend 
 But now she's somehow more broken. 
 She's pulling her weapon to her side 
 Loading it full of her goodbyes 
 Holding an enemy across the line 
 She's pulling her weapon to her side 
 Loading it full of her goodbyes 
 Holding an enemy across the line 
 With every battle he's choosing 
 With every fight he's losing 
 His enemy's not far behind 
 With every promise she's broken 
 With every lie she's spoken 
 Her enemy's not far behind 
 It's your time 
 It's your time 
 It's your time 
 It's your time! 
 He's pulling his weapon to his side 
 Loading it full of his goodbyes 
 Holding an enemy across the line 
 She's pulling her weapon to her side 
 Loading it full of her goodbyes 
 Holding an enemy across the line 
 With every battle he's choosing 
 With every fight he's losing 
 His enemy's not far behind 
 With every promise she's broken 
 With every lie she's spoken 
 Her enemy's not far behind
