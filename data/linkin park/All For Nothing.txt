Yeah, uh 
 So whatcha waiting for? 
 Anticipating more? 
 While you debate what it could take to instigate a war 
 Yeah, I been hated more than time I wasn't hated for 
 There's nothing they can fucking say they didn't say before 
 And you could never see it, your battle's not mine 
 Wanna skate and play it safe, but this is take-a-shot time 
 You're waiting for a purpose, I already got mine 
 While you tell me, step to it, like 
 One, two, three, four 
 And if I do what you demand 
 (You say) You'll let me understand 
 (You say) You're gonna hold me to your word 
 And if I sell myself away 
 (You say) I'll have no debt to pay 
 (You say) I'm gonna get what I deserve 
 Your word, obeyed 
 My debt, repaid 
 Our trust, betrayed 
 All for nothing, all for nothing 
 Kick back, there's no other way to say it 
 So let me break this fucker down for ya 
 I really don't know ya 
 You talk but let me show ya where to put your paranoia 
 You're joking, I don't have a half a sucker bone to throw ya 
 I'm disgusted, wonder what could've made ya tuck your tail below ya 
 And no, I'm not your soldier, I'm not taking any orders 
 I'm a five-star general infantry controller 
 Need a lesson? Let me show ya 
 Have you checking your composure 
 While I make you step to it, like 
 One, two, three, four 
 And if I do what you demand 
 (You say) You'll let me understand 
 (You say) You're gonna hold me to your word 
 And if I sell myself away 
 (You say) I'll have no debt to pay 
 (You say) I'm gonna get what I deserve 
 And if I do what you demand 
 You'll let me understand 
 Your word, obeyed 
 My debt, repaid 
 Our trust, betrayed 
 All for nothing, all for nothing 
 All for nothing, all for...
