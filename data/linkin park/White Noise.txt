You've been faking it all this time 
 You left my trust on the firing line 
 As the promises break the only mistakes giving you what was mine 
 Your words are clear but their meaning's gone 
 The notes are right but the tuning's wrong 
 And when you tell me again that I should give in 
 I can only take it so long long long long 
 You're terrified! Terrified! 
 You had to throw it all away! All away! All away! 
 You're terrified! Terrified! 
 You had to throw it all away! 
 Fear is dancing inside your eyes 
 Exposing secrets that you've disguised 
 And I'm biting my tongue as you've become a victim of a compromise 
 'Cause I know who you really are 
 Not a scratch when you pretend you're scarred 
 And it's time that you see the truth without me 
 I can only make it so far far far far 
 You're terrified! Terrified! 
 You had to throw it all away! All away! All away! 
 You're terrified! Terrified! 
 You had to throw it all away! 
 Throw it all away! All away! Way! 
 Throw it all away! All away! All away! Way! 
 Throw it all away! All away! All away! Way! 
 Throw it all away! All away! All away! Way! 
 Throw it all away! All aw- 
 You're terrified! Terrified! 
 You had to throw it all away! All away! All away! 
 You're terrified! Terrified! 
 You had to throw it all away! All away! All away! 
 You're terrified! Terrified! 
 You had to throw it all away! All away! All away! 
 You're terrified! Terrified! 
 You had to throw it all away!
