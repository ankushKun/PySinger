No control, no surprise 
 Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye 
 I'm my own casualty 
 I fuck up everything I see, fighting in futility 
 We start the final war 
 Tell me what's worth fighting for when we know there's nothing more 
 We take the hand or fist 
 Just to sell ourselves for this, the path we least resist 
 No control, no surprise 
 Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye 
 I'm my own casualty 
 I fuck up everything I see, fighting in futility 
 I give you what you came for, this is not the same though 
 Got a different method but I still can bring the pain, so 
 Y'all all get that same flow, I got that insane flow 
 High as y'all can get, you're never really in my range though 
 Yes, I'm half anglo, half fried panko 
 All prime-time rhymer, let that bass bang low 
 All you fucking lames, go, aiming at my name, know 
 Careful what you shoot, because you might hit what you aim for 
 (Careful what you shoot, because you might hit what you aim for) 
 No control, no surprise 
 Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye 
 I'm my own casualty 
 I fuck up everything I see, fighting in futility 
 No control, no surprise 
 Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye 
 I'm my own casualty 
 I'm my own casualty 
 I'm not allowed to say certain things 
 Try and do 
 Try and do the other thing 
 Real quick
