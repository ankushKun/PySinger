Shut up when I'm talking to you! 
 Shut up! 
 Shut up! 
 I'm talking to you! 
 I cannot take this anymore 
 Saying everything I've said before 
 All these words they make no sense 
 I found bliss in ignorance 
 Less I hear the less you'll say 
 You'll find that out anyway 
 Just like before 
 Everything you say to me 
 Takes me one step closer to the edge and I'm about to break 
 I need a little room to breathe 
 Because I'm one step closer to the edge, I'm about to break 
 I find the answers aren't so clear 
 Wish I could find a way to disappear 
 All these thoughts, they make no sense 
 I found bliss in ignorance 
 Nothing seems to go away 
 Over and over again 
 Just like before 
 Everything you say to me 
 Takes me one step closer to the edge and I'm about to break 
 I need a little room to breathe 
 Because I'm one step closer to the edge, I'm about to break 
 Everything you say to me 
 Takes me one step closer to the edge and I'm about to break 
 I need a little room to breathe 
 Because I'm one step closer to the edge, I'm about to break 
 Shut up when I'm talking to you 
 Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up when I'm talking to you 
 Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up 
 I'm about to break 
 Everything you say to me 
 Takes me one step closer to the edge and I'm about to break 
 I need a little room to breathe 
 Because I'm one step closer to the edge, I'm about to break 
 Everything you say to me 
 Takes me one step closer to the edge and I'm about to break 
 I need a little room to breathe 
 Because I'm one step closer to the edge, I'm about to break
