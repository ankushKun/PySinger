Uh, this is war with no weapons 
 Marching with no stepping 
 Murder with no killing 
 Illin' every direction 
 First, no sequel 
 Do the math, no equal 
 John with no Yoko 
 More power, less people 
 And no, I'm not afraid of that, print it in your paperback 
 Every rap is made in fact to act as a delayed attack 
 Every phrase a razor blade that's saved until they play it back 
 Slay and leave 'em laying on the pavement, bang, fade to black 
 In the wastelands of today 
 Where there's nothing left to lose 
 And there's nothing more to take 
 But you force yourself to choose 
 In the wastelands of today 
 Where tomorrow disappears 
 While the future slips away 
 And your hope turns into fear 
 In the wastelands of today 
 Roll credits, you get it, the show is done 
 They're talking for just talking 
 But meaning, they got none 
 None of 'em come proper, they talk like a shotgun 
 But how many got bred with integrity? Not one 
 So no, I'm not afraid to see these suckers hold a blade to me 
 Ain't a way to shake the ground I built before you came to be 
 Take it how you take it, I'm the opposite of vacancy 
 And this is not negotiation, y'all can hate and wait and see 
 In the wastelands of today 
 Where there's nothing left to lose 
 And there's nothing more to take 
 But you force yourself to choose 
 In the wastelands of today 
 Where tomorrow disappears 
 While the future slips away 
 And your hope turns into fear 
 And your hope turns into fear 
 In the wastelands of today 
 In the wastelands of today 
 Where there's nothing left to lose 
 And there's nothing more to take 
 But you force yourself to choose 
 In the wastelands of today 
 Where tomorrow disappears 
 While the future slips away 
 And your hope turns into fear 
 And your hope turns into fear 
 In the wastelands of today 
 In the wastelands of today 
 In the wastelands of today
