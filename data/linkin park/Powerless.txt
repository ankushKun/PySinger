You hid your skeletons when I had shown you mine 
 You woke the devil that I thought you’d left behind 
 I saw the evidence, the crimson soaking through 
 Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose 
 And you held it all, but you were careless to let it fall 
 You held it all, and I was by your side powerless 
 I watched you fall apart and chased you to the end 
 I'm left with emptiness that words cannot defend 
 You'll never know what I became because of you 
 Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose 
 And you held it all, but you were careless to let it fall 
 You held it all and I was by your side powerless 
 Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh 
 Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh 
 Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh 
 And you held it all, but you were careless to let it fall 
 You held it all, and I was by your side 
 (Powerless) 
 Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh 
 Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh (Powerless) 
 Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh (Powerless)
