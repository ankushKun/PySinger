Yeah 
 I am not a pattern to be followed 
 The pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow 
 I'm not a criminal, not a role model 
 Not a born leader; I'm a tough act to follow 
 I am not the fortune and the fame 
 Or the same person telling you to forfeit the game 
 I came in the ring like a dog on a chain 
 And I found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems 
 And it seems ugly, but it can get worse 
 'Cause even the blueprint is a gift and a curse 
 'Cause once you got the theory of how the thing works 
 Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first 
 And I'm not a robot, I'm not a monkey 
 I will not dance even if the beat's funky 
 Opposite of lazy, far from a punk 
 Y'all ought to stop talking, start trying to catch up, motherfucker 
 And all the people say 
 Try to catch up motherfucker 
 Lauryn said money change a situation 
 Big said it increase the complication 
 Kane said don't step, I ain't the one 
 Chuck said that Uzi weigh a motherfucking ton 
 And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me 
 Rocking every stage and every place that it brought me 
 I'm awfully underrated, but came here to correct it 
 And so it ain't mistaken, I'mma state it for the record 
 I am the opposite of whack; opposite of weak 
 Opposite of slack; synonym of heat; synonym of crack 
 Closest to a peak, far from a punk 
 Y'all ought to stop talking, start trying to catch up, motherfucker 
 And all the people say 
 Try to catch up motherfucker 
 Oh, when they come for me 
 Come for me, I'll be gone 
 Oh, when they come for me 
 Come for me, I'll be gone 
 Oh, when they come for me 
 Come for me, I'll be gone 
 And all the people say 
 Try to catch up motherfucker 
 And all the people say 
 Try to catch up motherfucker
