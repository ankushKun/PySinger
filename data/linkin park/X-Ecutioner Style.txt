 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! 
 Shut up! (When I'm talking to you!) 
 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! 
 Shut up! I'm about to- 
 Wasn't that fun, let's try something else... 
 Forty-five calibre killer, but out of the philla–della–rella 
 Show y'all brothers how you not a gorilla 
 Smooth talking, fully automatic weapon concealer 
 Taste thriller, break thriller 
 Let's hit 'em with the bounce filler 
 Filthy stinking, standing on solid ground 
 And still be sinking, submerging in the parks 
 Still be linking, plucked beef when it starts 
 To fuck your thinking, it's not a mirage 
 I'm in the motherfucking tractor from out the garage 
 With an if, you can duck, but it's hard to dodge 
 In the back of the spine where my darts is lodged 
 Going to flip it straight up/ripping apart your squad 
 X-Ecutioner style, cuts and blends like a syringe 
 Hanging you from each of your limbs 
 See me coming through your party hard without no bodyguard 
 Smoking something, stomping on each of you Tims 
 I'm the B–to–the–L, the A, the C, King 
 And when it comes to planning 
 The thought to keep thinking, man 
 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! 
 Shut up! 
 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! 
 Shut up!
