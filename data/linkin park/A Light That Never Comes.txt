Nah, you don't know me 
 Lightning above and a fire below me 
 You can not catch me, can not hold me 
 You can not stop, much less control me 
 When it rains, it pours 
 When the floodgates open, brace your shores 
 That pressure don't care when it breaks your doors 
 Say it's all you can take, better take some more 
 'Cause I know what its like to test fate 
 Had my shoulders pressed with that weight 
 Stood up strong in spite of that hate 
 The night gets darkest right before dawn 
 What don't kill you makes you more strong 
 And I've been waiting for it so long 
 The nights go on 
 Waiting for a light that never comes 
 I chase the sun 
 Waiting for a light that never comes 
 Oh... Oh... Oh... 
 Waiting for a light that never comes 
 When I was young, they told me, they said 
 Make your bed, you lie in that bed 
 A King can only rein 'till instead 
 There comes that day, it's off with his head 
 The night gets darkest right before dawn 
 What don't kill you makes you more strong 
 You'll have my mercy, then when you're gone 
 The nights go on 
 Waiting for a light that never comes 
 I chase the sun 
 Waiting for a light that never comes 
 Oh... Oh... Oh... 
 Waiting for a light that never comes 
 And I told them; nah you don't know me 
 Lightning above and a fire below me 
 You can not catch me, can not hold me 
 You can not stop, much less control me 
 When it rains, it pours 
 When the floodgates open, brace your shores 
 That pressure don't care, it breaks your doors 
 Say it's all you can take, better take some more 
 Oh... Oh... Oh... 
 Waiting for a light that never comes 
 The nights go on 
 Waiting for a light that never comes 
 I chase the sun 
 Waiting for a light that never comes 
 Oh... Oh... Oh... 
 Waiting for a light that never comes
