Tell us all again what you think we should be 
 What the answers are, what it is we can't see 
 Tell us all again, how to do what you say 
 How to fall in line, how there's no other way 
 But oh, we all know 
 You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed 
 You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame 
 You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed 
 You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame 
 You're guilty all the same 
 Show us all again that our hands are unclean 
 That we're unprepared, that you have what we need 
 Show us all again, 'cause we cannot be saved 
 'Cause the end is near, now there's no other way 
 And oh, you will know 
 You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed 
 You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame 
 You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed 
 You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame 
 There's no one else to blame 
 Guilty all the same 
 Guilty all the same 
 You're guilty all the same 
 Yeah, you already know what it is 
 Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this 
 When a man has plans of being rich? 
 But the bosses' plans is wealthy? 
 Dirty money scheme 
 A clean split is nonsense 
 It's insane, even corporate hands is filthy 
 They talk team and take the paper route 
 All they think about is bank accounts 
 Assets and realty at anybody's expense 
 No shame with a clear conscience 
 No regrets and guilt free 
 They claim that ain't the way that they built me 
 The smokescreen, before the flame 
 Knowing as soon as the dough or deal peak 
 They say it's time for things to change 
 Rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap 
 Anything if it's more to gain 
 Drained, manipulated like artists, its real deep 
 Until no more remains 
 But I'm still me 
 Like authentic hip-hop and rock 
 'Til pop and radio, and record companies killed me 
 Try to force me to stray and obey 
 They got the gall to say how real can real be? 
 You feel me? We'll see 
 The green could be to blame 
 Or greedy for the fame, TV or a name 
 The media, the game 
 To me you're all the same 
 You're guilty 
 You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed 
 You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame 
 You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed 
 You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame 
 You're guilty all the same 
 Guilty all the same 
 Guilty all the same 
 Guilty all the same
