A smoke alarm went off at night, 
 I woke up wipe the sleep out of my eye, 
 She left a note "I'll be back in five", 
 Well I'm still waiting for that moment to arrive, 
 And I was told to put my job in front of you, 
 But it won't hold me like you do. 
 But I do it for the love, 
 Waiting on the gold rush, 
 Keep it on the edge, 
 Smoking on a roll-up, 
 When I see my friends, 
 All they say is "Hold up, 
 Ed, remember the time, 
 When we were in school, 
 Listening to grown-ups, 
 Didn't learn a thing, 
 But then again you know what, 
 You know how to sing, 
 But you don't know anything other than that, 
 So maybe you should learn to love her, 
 Like, like the way, 
 And maybe you should learn to love her, 
 Like, like the way, 
 And maybe you should learn to love her, 
 Like, like the way, 
 And maybe you should learn to love her, 
 Like, like the way you wanna be loved." 
 I never told her that I liked, 
 The way she dances, slightly out of time, 
 And pretends she knows the words, 
 To a song she never heard, 
 But I tell her all the time, 
 Well, I was told to put my job in front of you, 
 But it won't hold me like you do.
