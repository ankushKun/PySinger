Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon 
 But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song 
 My daddy told me, "Son, don't you get involved in 
 Politics, religions or other people's quarrels" 
 I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene 
 I know when I have children they will know what it means 
 And I'll pass on these things my family's given to me 
 Just love, and understanding, positivity 
 We could change this whole world with a piano 
 Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go 
 I'm just a boy with a one-man show 
 No university, no degree, but lord knows 
 Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth 
 And the stock market crashing and their portfolios 
 While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote 
 Sing, love can change the world in a moment 
 But what do I know? 
 Love can change the world in a moment 
 But what do I know? 
 Love can change the world in a moment 
 The revolution's coming, it's a minute away 
 I saw people marching in the streets today 
 You know we are made up of love and hate 
 But both of them are balanced on a razor blade 
 I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene 
 I know, I'm all for people following their dreams 
 Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans 
 It's love and understanding, positivity 
 We could change this whole world with a piano 
 Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go 
 I'm just a boy with a one-man show 
 No university, no degree, but lord knows 
 Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth 
 And the stock market crashing and their portfolios 
 While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote 
 Sing, love can change the world in a moment 
 But what do I know? 
 Love can change the world in a moment 
 But what do I know? 
 Love can change the world in a moment 
 I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene 
 You know, the future's in the hands of you and me 
 So let's all get together, we can all be free 
 Spread love and understanding, positivity 
 We could change this whole world with a piano 
 Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go 
 I'm just a boy with a one-man show 
 No university, no degree, but lord knows 
 Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth 
 And the stock market crashing and their portfolios 
 While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote 
 Sing, love can change the world in a moment 
 But what do I know? 
 Love can change the world in a moment 
 But what do I know? 
 Love can change the world in a moment
