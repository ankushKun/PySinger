I know you heard this before 
 I know you heard this before 
 It's working for sure 
 Gonna be hurting tomorrow 
 But tonight, hey hey 
 We're going for it (don't judge me) 
 Tonight, we're going for it (come touch me) 
 Tonight, we're going for it (like you love me) 
 Tonight, we're going for it (hear me out) 
 We've come to have a good time 
 And we won't compromise 
 We wanna hear the fellas 
 We wanna feel the lights 
 Automatic wine 
 My money stacked so high 
 It feels like stick like tie 
 Takes the smallest slice 
 It still touch the sky 
 Tonight we're going turbo 
 The dance-hall is packed to the curb yo 
 We're gonna eat a lot of merlot 
 But the question is where'd I just go 
 So let them say what they want to about us 
 When they say your name 
 They're lifting you 
 So let them say what they want to about us 
 When they say your name 
 They're lifting you 
 I know you heard this before 
 I know you heard this before 
 It's working for sure 
 Gonna be hurting tomorrow 
 But tonight, hey hey 
 We're going for it (don't judge me) 
 Tonight, we're going for it (come touch me) 
 Tonight, we're going for it (like you love me) 
 Tonight, we're going for it (hear me out) 
 You ever seen one girl take over the night? 
 Take over the city and restore its pride 
 If you're gonna roll a blunt 
 Then roll a blunt right 
 The room is too dark 
 Someone spark up the light 
 Police, got the strap on the side 
 My people still fly the kite 
 But I learned from my grandma 
 To master my eye 
 Oh shit I'm talking too much 
 I'm too fucking hyped 
 Tonight we're going turbo 
 The dance-hall is packed to the curb yo 
 We're gonna eat a lot of merlot 
 But the question is where'd I just go 
 So let them say what they want to about us 
 When they say your name 
 They're lifting you 
 So let them say what they want to about us 
 When they say your name 
 They're lifting you 
 I know you heard this before 
 I know you heard this before 
 It's working for sure 
 Gonna be hurting tomorrow 
 But tonight, hey hey...
