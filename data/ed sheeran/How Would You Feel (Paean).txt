You are the one, girl 
 And you know that it's true 
 I'm feeling younger 
 Every time that I'm alone with you 
 We were sitting in a parked car 
 Stealing kisses in a front yard 
 We got questions we should not ask, but 
 How would you feel 
 If I told you I loved you 
 It's just something that I want to do 
 I'll be taking my time 
 Spending my life 
 Falling deeper in love with you 
 So tell me that you love me too 
 In the summer 
 As the lilacs bloom 
 Blood flows deeper than a river 
 Every moment that I spend with you 
 We were sat upon our best friend's roof 
 I had both of my arms around you 
 Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but 
 How would you feel 
 If I told you I loved you 
 It's just something that I want to do 
 I'll be taking my time 
 Spending my life 
 Falling deeper in love with you 
 So tell me that you love me too 
 Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car 
 Stealing kisses in a front yard 
 We got questions we should not ask 
 How would you feel 
 If I told you I loved you 
 It's just something that I want to do 
 I'll be taking my time 
 Spending my life 
 Falling deeper in love with you 
 Tell me that you love me too 
 Tell me that you love me too 
 Tell me that you love me too
