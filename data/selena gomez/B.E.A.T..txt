It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand 
 And the beat in my face 
 It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand 
 And the beat in my face 
 Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face, 
 The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face 
 Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face, 
 The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face 
 I'm a make you bend your back 
 Oh my God this beat is crack 
 When I do this, you do that 
 I feel like dancing when I hear that sound 
 Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh 
 I feel like dancing when I hear that sound 
 Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh 
 It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand 
 And the beat in my face 
 It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand 
 And the beat in my face 
 Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face, 
 The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face 
 Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face, 
 The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face 
 I'm a bring the party back 
 We gon blow the thermostate 
 When I do this, you do that 
 I feel like dancing when I hear that sound 
 Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh 
 I feel like dancing when I hear that sound 
 Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh 
 It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand 
 And the beat in my face 
 It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand 
 And the beat, beat, beat, beat... 
 Automatic, dance-natic, I can get enough 
 I can get enough, I can get enough, of that beat in my face 
 Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face, 
 The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face 
 Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face, 
 The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face
