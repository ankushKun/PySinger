Happier times flashed through my mind 
 We both say it's over 
 And I believe it this time 
 All the pain that I hide 
 Let it play through the night 
 A sad sad serenade 
 Sad sad seranade 
 We almost got it right 
 A sad sad serenade 
 Sad seranade 
 For every broken heart tonight 
 All the love that we made 
 Turn it up, let it play 
 A sad sad serenade 
 Sad serenade 
 I won't regret 
 What I won't forget 
 Memories and your number 
 Are all I have left 
 I wish you the best, I really do 
 Even though I know that I'm still not over you 
 I know that we both are to blame 
 I can't believe you didn't fight harder for me 
 Is a sad sad serenade 
 Sad serenade 
 We almost got it right 
 A sad sad serenade 
 Sad serenade 
 For every broken heart tonight 
 All the love that we made 
 Turn it up, let it play 
 A sad sad serenade 
 Sad serenade 
 The more you love 
 The more it hurts 
 When it ends 
 When it's over 
 All that's left are the memories 
 Playing over and over 
 In your head 
 In your heart 
 Turn it up 
 Make it stop 
 Tonight all over the world 
 The most beautiful song ever heard 
 Is a sad sad serenade 
 Sad serenade 
 We almost got it right 
 A sad sad serenade 
 Sad serenade 
 For every broken heart tonight 
 All the love that we made 
 Turn it up, let it play 
 A sad sad serenade 
 Sad serenade 
 A sad sad serenade 
 Sad serenade
