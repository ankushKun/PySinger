I'm in my 14 carats, I'm 14 carat 
 Doing it up like Midas, mmm 
 Now you say I got a touch, so good, so good 
 Make you never wanna leave, so don't, so don't 
 Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight 
 Do my hair up real, real nice 
 And syncopate my skin to your heart beating 
 'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh 
 I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh 
 Let me show you how proud I am to be yours 
 Leave this dress a mess on the floor 
 And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh 
 I'm on my Marquise diamonds, I'm a Marquise diamond 
 Could even make that Tiffany jealous, mmm 
 You say I give it to you hard, so bad, so bad 
 Make you never wanna leave, I won't, I won't 
 Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight 
 Do my hair up real, real nice 
 And syncopate my skin to how you're breathing 
 'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh 
 I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh 
 Let me show you how proud I am to be yours 
 Leave this dress a mess on the floor 
 And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh 
 Trust me, I can take you there 
 Trust me, I can take you there 
 Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I 
 I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh 
 Baby, let me be good to you, good to you, uh-huh 
 Let me show you how proud I am to be yours 
 Leave this dress a mess on the floor 
 And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh 
 Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I
