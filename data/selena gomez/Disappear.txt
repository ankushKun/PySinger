Disappear! 
 I remember the first time 
 But it wasn't the last time that you told me that 
 You'd take me back 
 So I'm still wondering why 
 It was ever a question 
 Should've learned my lesson 
 I keep coming back 
 Like a heart attack 
 That's always breaking 
 I can't let you vanish 
 There's no magic 
 When you're gone 
 You say you don't need me 
 You say there's something beneath me 
 I'm not gonna let you disappear 
 I don't wanna hear it 
 I don't wanna believe it 
 I'm not gonna let you disappear 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Disappear 
 I don't wanna be lonely 
 But you were always the only one 
 Who cast the spell 
 And make it feel like 
 All of this was real 
 Nothing but an illusion 
 But I'm not gonna lose ya 
 So just do your trick 
 And make it quick 
 'Cause I'm pretending 
 I can't let you vanish 
 There's no magic 
 When you're gone 
 You say you don't need me 
 You say there's something beneath me 
 I'm not gonna let you disappear 
 I don't wanna hear it 
 I don't wanna believe it 
 I'm not gonna let you disappear 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Disappear 
 Don't Go! 
 I can't let you vanish 
 There's no magic 
 When you're gone 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Disappear 
 You say you don't need me 
 You say there's something beneath me 
 I'm not gonna let you disappear 
 I don't wanna hear it 
 I don't wanna believe it 
 I'm not gonna let you disappear 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Disappear 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Disappear 
 Don't Go!
