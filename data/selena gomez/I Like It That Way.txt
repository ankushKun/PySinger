You're so hot (not?) 
 But if I can be honest 
 Baby, you're all that I've got 
 You're so cool (not?) 
 But if you didn't notice 
 You got me playing a fool 
 With you 
 'Cause you're not my type 
 This can't be true 
 I don't know why 
 I'm all about you 
 If it's real then tell me so 
 'Cause I'm not letting you go 
 We will never change 
 It ain't that a love but it I like it that way 
 We will never change our minds 
 But I want you to stay up all night 
 Across the line 
 Cause wrong is right when we're together 
 We will never change 
 It ain't that a love but I like it that way 
 You're so... you (ew, grows) 
 But there's something about ya 
 It's making me feel like I do 
 With you 
 'Cause you're not my type 
 This can't be true 
 I don't know why 
 I'm all about you 
 If it's real then tell me so 
 'Cause I'm not letting you go 
 We will never change 
 It ain't that a love but it I like it that way 
 We will never change our minds 
 But I want you to stay up all night 
 Across the line 
 Cause wrong is right when we're together 
 We will never change 
 It ain't that a love but I like it that way 
 Not my type 
 This can't be true 
 We will 
 I'm all about you 
 If it's real 
 You got me sick 
 'Cause I'm not letting go 
 We will never change 
 It ain't that a love but it I like it that way 
 We will never change our minds 
 But I want you to stay up all night 
 Across the line 
 Cause wrong is right when we're together 
 We will never change 
 It ain't that a love but I like it that way.
