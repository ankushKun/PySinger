You caught my eye and I'm tryin' to holler at 'cha 
 You're walkin' by and I trip on the furniture 
 I'm on a ride that won't stop movin' 
 And I don't know exactly what I'm doin' 
 I see you shake, shake and I'm spinnin' 
 It's like I won the race, yeah I'm winning 
 I'm all dizzy when you're here with me 
 So let's bring the heat 
 'Cause there ain't nothing to it, just got to do it 
 You've got to own it, own it 
 Welcome to the beat of your own drum 
 And you got it like that, burn it up like that 
 Welcome to the beat of your own drum 
 If you got it like that, yeah, it's hot like that 
 Eh, eh, yeah, I'll will make you say, eh, eh 
 So bang a drum, bang a drum 
 You got me floatin' ten feet off the ground 
 It's like whoa, I'm not backin' down 
 My hearts pumpin' and it's workin' over time 
 I got the crazy butterflies 
 We're doin' it right when we're together 
 With you by my side it only gets better 
 Your on my team, we got it figured out 
 It's you and me no doubt 
 There ain't nothing to it, just got to do it 
 You've got to own it, own it 
 Welcome to the beat of your own drum 
 If it's hot like that, burn it up like that 
 Welcome to the beat, you gotta dip it down low 
 If you got it like that, yeah, it's hot like that 
 Eh, eh, yeah, I'll will make you say, eh, eh 
 So bang a drum, bang a drum 
 Yeah, bang a drum, turn it up, bang a drum 
 Yeah, bang a drum, turn it up, bang a drum 
 You caught my eye and I'm tryin' to holler at 'cha 
 You're walkin' by and I trip on the furniture
