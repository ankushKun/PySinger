It's been said and done 
 Every beautiful thought's been already sung 
 And I guess right now here's another one 
 So your melody will play on and on 
 With the best of 'em 
 You are beautiful 
 Like a dream come alive, incredible 
 A centerfold, miracle, lyrical 
 You've saved my life again 
 And I want you to know baby 
 I-I love you like a love song, baby 
 I-I love you like a love song, baby 
 I-I love you like a love song, baby 
 And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat 
 I-I love you like a love song, baby 
 I-I love you like a love song, baby 
 I-I love you like a love song, baby 
 And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat 
 Constantly, boy you played through my mind like a symphony 
 There's no way to describe what you do to me 
 You just do to me, what you do 
 And it feels like I've been rescued 
 I've been set free 
 I am hypnotized by your destiny 
 You are magical, lyrical, beautiful 
 You are, and I want you to know baby 
 I-I love you like a love song, baby 
 I-I love you like a love song, baby 
 I-I love you like a love song, baby 
 And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat 
 I-I love you like a love song, baby 
 I-I love you like a love song, baby 
 I-I love you like a love song, baby 
 And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat 
 (I love you, I love you like a love song) 
 No one compares 
 You stand alone to every record I own 
 Music to my heart that's what you are 
 A song that goes on and on 
 I-I love you like a love song, baby 
 I-I love you like a love song, baby 
 I-I love you like a love song, baby 
 And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat 
 I-I love you like a love song, baby 
 I-I love you like a love song, baby 
 I-I love you like a love song, baby 
 I love you, like a love song
