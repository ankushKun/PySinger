I had a dream 
 We were sipping whiskey neat 
 Highest floor, The Bowery 
 And I was high enough 
 Somewhere along the lines 
 We stopped seeing eye to eye 
 You were staying out all night 
 And I had enough 
 No, I don't wanna know 
 Where you been or where you're goin' 
 But I know I won't be home 
 And you'll be on your own 
 Who's gonna walk you 
 Through the dark side of the morning? 
 Who's gonna rock you 
 When the sun won't let you sleep? 
 Who's waking up to drive you home 
 When you're drunk and all alone? 
 Who's gonna walk you 
 Through the dark side of the morning? 
 If it ain't me 
 (The Bowery, whiskey neat, where do I go, where do I go) 
 If it ain't me 
 (The Bowery, whiskey neat, where do I go, where do I go) 
 If it ain't me 
 (The Bowery, whiskey neat, where do I go, where do I go) 
 If it ain't me 
 (The Bowery, whiskey neat, where do I go, where do I go) 
 If it ain't me 
 I had a dream 
 We were back to seventeen 
 Summer nights and the liberties 
 Never growing up 
 I'll take with me 
 The Polaroids and the memories 
 But you know I'm gonna leave 
 Behind the worst of us 
 Who's gonna walk you 
 Through the dark side of the morning? 
 Who's gonna rock you 
 When the sun won't let you sleep? 
 Who's waking up to drive you home 
 When you're drunk and all alone? 
 Who's gonna walk you 
 Through the dark side of the morning? 
 If it ain't me, no no 
 If it ain't me, no no 
 If it ain't me, no no 
 If it ain't me, no no 
 Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning? 
 If it ain't me 
 (The Bowery, whiskey neat, where do I go, where do I go) 
 If it ain't me 
 (The Bowery, whiskey neat, where do I go) 
 If it ain't me 
 (The Bowery, whiskey neat, where do I go, where do I go) 
 If it ain't me 
 (The Bowery, whiskey neat, where do I go, where do I go) 
 If it ain't me 
 (The Bowery, whiskey neat, where do I go, where do I go) 
 If it ain't me
