Oh, oh, oh, 
 It's magic! 
 You know, 
 Never believe it's not so! 
 It's magic! 
 You know, 
 Never believe it's not so! 
 I've never been awake, 
 I've never seen a day break, 
 Leaning on my pillow in the morning. 
 A lazy day in bed, music in my head, 
 Crazy music playing in the morning 
 Light! 
 Oh, oh, oh, 
 It's magic! 
 You know, 
 Never believe it's not so! 
 It's magic! 
 You know, 
 Never believe it's not so! 
 I love a sunny day, 
 A dream of far away, 
 Dreaming on my pillow in the morning. 
 I've never been awake, 
 I've never seen a day break, 
 Leaning on my pillow in the morning 
 Light! 
 Oh, oh, oh, 
 It's magic! 
 You know, 
 Never believe it's not so! 
 It's magic! 
 You know, 
 Never believe it's not so! 
 Oh, oh, oh, 
 It's magic! 
 You know, 
 Never believe it's not so! 
 It's magic! 
 You know, 
 Never believe it's not so! 
 Never believe...
