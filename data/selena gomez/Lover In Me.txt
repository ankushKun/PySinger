In the dark we can see 
 Feel your hand touching me 
 Run away from the world outside we know 
 In your lips I confide 
 In our love we can hide 
 Run away from our world outside we know 
 And when I waken next to you 
 I know we're not the lonely people that we used to be 
 I'm never giving up on this 
 The lover in me is the lover in you 
 And you can't stop my heart 
 You're taking on me like I'm taking on you 
 And it's my favorite part 
 Don't let go, don't let go tonight 
 And you can't stop my heart 
 The lover in me is the lover in you 
 'Cause we fit perfectly when you lay over me 
 Run away from the world outside we know 
 And when I waken next to you 
 I know we're not the lonely people that we used to be 
 I'm never giving up on this 
 The lover in me is the lover in you 
 And you can't stop my heart 
 You're taking on me like I'm taking on you 
 And it's my favorite part 
 Don't let go, don't let go tonight 
 And you can't stop my heart 
 The lover in me is the lover in you 
 The lover in me is the lover in you tonight 
 And you can't stop my heart 
 The lover in me is the lover in you tonight 
 And it's my favorite part 
 The lover in me is the lover in you 
 And you can't stop my heart 
 You're taking on me like I'm taking on you 
 And it's my favorite part 
 Don't let go, don't let go tonight 
 And you can't stop my heart 
 The lover in me is the lover in you
