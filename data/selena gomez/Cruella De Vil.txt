Ooh, ooh oh oh, ooh oh 
 Look out for Cruella De Vil 
 Cruella De Vil 
 Cruella De Vil 
 If she doesn't scare you 
 No evil thing will 
 To see her is to take a sudden chill 
 Cruella, Cruella De Vil 
 The curl of her lips 
 The ice in her stare 
 All innocent children had better beware 
 She's like a spider waiting for the kill 
 Look out for Cruella De Vil... 
 Cruella, Cruella De Vil 
 If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will 
 Cruella, Cruella De Vil 
 To see her is to take a sudden chill 
 Cruella De Vil... 
 Ooh, ooh oh oh, ooh oh 
 ... 
 This vampire bat 
 This inhuman beast 
 She 'outta be locked up and never released 
 The world was such a wholesome place until 
 Cruella, Cruella De Vil 
 Yeah! 
 Cruella, Cruella De Vil 
 If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will 
 Cruella, Cruella De Vil 
 To see her is to take a sudden chill 
 Cruella De Vil... 
 Ooh, ooh oh oh, ooh oh 
 (Ooh oh, ooh oh, ooh oh, ooh oh) 
 At first you think Cruella is the devil 
 But after time has worn away the shock 
 You've come to realize 
 You've seen her kind of eyes 
 Watching you from underneath a ROOOOOOOCK! 
 Cruella, Cruella De Vil 
 If she doesn't scare you no evil thing will 
 Cruella, Cruella De Vil 
 To see her is to take a sudden chill 
 Cruella, Cruella De Vil 
 If she doesn't scare you no evil thing will 
 Cruella, Cruella De Vil 
 To see her is to take a sudden chill 
 Cruella De Vil 
 Ooh, ooh oh oh, ooh oh (Cruella De Vil!) 
 Ooh, ooh oh oh, ooh oh (Cruella De Vil!) 
 Ooh, ooh oh oh, ooh oh
