Ever try to reach for something 
 But it's someone else's dream? 
 Every step that you take forward 
 It takes you right back where you been 
 And then when you least expect it 
 And you've tried about everything 
 Somebody hears your opinions 
 Somebody cares what you see 
 You woke me up 
 No longer tired 
 With you I feel inspired 
 You help me find my fire 
 You're the new classic 
 You're the new PYT 
 Stands for paid, young and 
 Taking on the world from the driver's seat 
 You look so classic, fantastic 
 When you're on that floor 
 Bring the beat back once more 
 Let me see you do that 
 Oh trying to do it right 
 No rehearsals 
 It's your life 
 If you're doing this crazy dance 
 Cause your making these crazy plans 
 It's just this is not a test 
 You put in work to be the best 
 It's a classic take 
 On a brand new game 
 Before the needle drops 
 They're gonna know your name 
 When it gets old don't lose the light 
 You're cold, I'll warm you up 
 Your fire is hot enough, enough, enough 
 You're the new classic 
 You're the new PYT 
 Stands for paid, young and 
 Trying everything just to touch your dreams 
 You look so classic, fantastic 
 Oh when you're on that floor 
 Bring the beat back once more 
 Let me see you do that 
 It's become so hard 
 For me to be surprised 
 You're bringing back the real me 
 No judgment in your eyes 
 'Cause when I dance with you 
 It's how I speak the truth 
 Just classic when we met 
 Now you make me new 
 You're the new classic 
 You're the new PYT 
 Stands for paid, young and 
 Taking on the world from the driver's seat 
 You look so classic, fantastic 
 When you on that floor 
 Bring the beat back once more 
 (Bring the beat back once more) 
 You're the new classic 
 You're the new PYT 
 Stands for paid, young and 
 Taking on the world from the driver's seat 
 You look so classic, fantastic 
 When you're on that floor 
 Bring the beat back once more 
 Bring it back, bring it back 
 Let me see you do that 
 You're the new classic 
 You're the new PYT 
 Stands for paid, young and 
 Taking on the world from the driver's seat 
 You're the new classic, fantastic 
 When you're on that floor 
 Bring the beat back once more 
 Let me see you do that
