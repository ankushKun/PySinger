I was walking down the street the other day 
 Tryna distract myself 
 But then I see your face 
 Oh wait, that's someone else 
 Oh oh, tryna play it coy 
 Tryna make it disappear 
 But just like the battle of Troy 
 There's nothing settled here 
 In my room there's a king size space 
 Bigger than it used to be 
 If you want you can rent that place 
 Call me an amenity 
 Even if it's in my dreams 
 Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind 
 Ooh every time I watch you serpentine 
 Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' 
 Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' 
 Not to think about you 
 No, no, no, no, not to think about you 
 No, no, no, no, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' 
 Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' 
 Not to give in to you 
 No, no, no, no, not to give in to you 
 With my feelings on fire 
 Guess I'm a bad liar 
 I see how your tension builds 
 It's like looking in a mirror 
 Your touch like a happy pill 
 But still all we do is fear 
 What could possibly happen next? 
 Can we focus on the love? 
 Paint my kiss across your chest 
 If you're the art, I'll be the brush 
 Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind 
 Ooh every time I watch you serpentine 
 Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' 
 Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' 
 Not to think about you (not to think about you) 
 No, no, no, no, not to think about you (not to think about you) 
 No, no, no, no, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' 
 Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' 
 Not to give in to you (give in to you) 
 No, no, no, no, not to give in to you (give in to you) 
 With my feelings on fire 
 Guess I'm a bad liar 
 And oh baby let's make 
 Reality, actuality, a reality 
 Oh baby let's make 
 Reality, actuality, a reality 
 Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' 
 Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' 
 Not to think about you (not to think about you) 
 No, no, no, no, not to think about you (not to think about you) 
 No, no, no, no, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' 
 Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' 
 Not to give in to you (give in to you) 
 No, no, no, no, not to give in to you (give in to you) 
 With my feelings on fire 
 Guess I'm a bad liar
