Just drive I'm sick of talking 
 We know where this is going 
 I'm done, take me home 
 I can't wait forever for you to get 
 Yourself together, I rather be alone 
 I'm so tired of pretending 
 Just want a happy ending 
 Wish I could put a spell on you 
 Wish I could make you feel like I do 
 Wouldn't that be sweet? So magical 
 Wish I could blink and wave a wand 
 Get everything that I ever wanted 
 And put a spell on you, make it all come true 
 You taught me what I know 
 Guys like you come and go 
 But I know things can change 
 See my heart, maybe broken 
 But that won't stop me hoping 
 Wish I could put a spell on you 
 Wish I could make you feel like I do 
 Wouldn't that be sweet? So magical 
 Wish I could blink and wave a wand 
 Get everything that I ever wanted 
 And put a spell on you, make it all come true 
 I just wanna know what we should've done 
 When I figured out what we could've become 
 'Cause I know in my heart I know I'm not over you 
 I just wanna go back and try it again 
 Turn back the time, this isn't the end of us 
 It isn't the end of us, it isn't the end of us, whoa 
 Wish I could put a spell on you 
 Wish I could make you feel like I do 
 Wouldn't that be sweet? So magical 
 Wish I could blink and wave a wand 
 Get everything that I ever wanted 
 And put a spell on you, make it all come true 
 Wish I could put a spell on you 
 Wish I could make you feel like I do 
 Wouldn't that be sweet? So magical 
 Wish I could blink and wave a wand 
 Get everything that I ever wanted 
 And put a spell on you, make it all come true
