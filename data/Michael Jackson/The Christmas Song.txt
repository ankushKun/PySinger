I watch the snowflake fall 
 Against my window pain 
 And wonder if you 
 Are watching snowflakes too 
 I take a walk downtown 
 To where you used to meet me 
 Theres joy everywhere 
 But all that waiting there is 
 Just a little Christmas tree 
 Lookin sorta sad and lonely just like me 
 No one seems to care 
 They just went away and left it standing there 
 All alone on Christmas eve 
 I hear the Christmas bells 
 Bum Bum Bum 
 The happy people singing 
 The songs of good cheer that only brings me tears 
 I sadly close my eyes 
 And say a little prayer 
 Youll be waiting there for me 
 I look but all I see is 
 This is the season of love 
 This is the season of love 
 But Im as sad as I can be 
 Sad as can be 
 Why did you have to leave me 
 Why did you leave me 
 Why did you leave me
