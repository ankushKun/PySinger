- "At this time... I just like to sing." 
 Here in this lonely room 
 Late in the afternoon 
 Dreaming my life away-hey 
 Don't answer the telephone 
 I'm not home receiving you 
 Here in the afternoon 
 Alone in some stranger's room 
 What am I doing here at all? 
 No need to over do it 
 I'm bleeding now 
 I'm bleeding now 
 Stop the bleeding now 
 Stop the bleeding now 
 Oozing out 
 Dripping down 
 Table's silent shout 
 Aghhh! 
 (Scat sing and whistle) 
 Stop the bleeding now
