Remember when you were young? 
 How the hero was never hung 
 Always got away 
 Remember how the man 
 Used to leave you empty handed? 
 Always, always let you down 
 If you ever change your mind 
 About leaving it all behind 
 Remember, remember, today 
 And don't feel sorry 
 The way it's gone 
 And don't you worry 
 'Bout what you've done 
 Just remember when you were small 
 How people seemed so tall 
 Always had their way 
 Do you remember your Ma and Pa 
 Just wishing for movie stardom 
 Always, always playing a part 
 If you ever feel so sad 
 And the whole world is driving you mad 
 Remember, remember, today 
 And don't feel sorry 
 'Bout the way it's gone 
 And don't you worry 
 'Bout what you've done 
 No, no, remember, remember
