Yeah 
 Ooh 
 I got a girl named Bony Moronie 
 She's as skinny as a stick of macaroni 
 Got to see her rock 'n' roll with her blue jeans on 
 She's not very fat, just skin and bone 
 Well now, I love her, and she loves me 
 Oh how happy now we gonna be 
 Makin' love underneath the apple tree 
 Well, I told her mama and her papa too 
 Just exactly what I'm gonna do 
 We're gonna get married on a night in June 
 Rock and roll by the light of the silvery moon 
 Wow, yeah 
 Well now, I love her, and she loves me 
 Oh how happy now we gonna be 
 Makin' love underneath the apple tree 
 Makin' love, baby 
 Well, she's my one and only, she's my heart's desire 
 She's a real upsetter, she's a real live wire 
 Everybody's watchin' when my baby walks by 
 She's so good lookin', really catches the eye 
 Well now, I love her, she loves me 
 Oh how happy now we gonna be 
 Makin' love underneath the apple tree 
 Yeah yeah 
 Makin' love 
 Makin' love 
 Makin' love
