-"Okay, okay, shall we try another one? It's the intro that we're worst on now, a bit slow isn't it?" 
 -"Yeah" 
 -"Yeah, too ...?... on the tom toms or something, about four, okay, shall we try it? Okay boys, this is it! Hey, hey one, two, three, four" 
 When I was a little boy 
 Way back home in Liverpool 
 My mama told me, I was great 
 Then when I was a teenager 
 I knew that I had got something going 
 My baby told me I was great 
 Now I'm a man 
 A woman took me by the hand 
 And she told me I was great 
 I was in the greatest show on earth 
 For what it was worth 
 And now I'm thirty-two 
 And all I wanna do, is boogaloo! 
 Hey! 
 Yeah, I look at myself in the mirror 
 I see my wife and kids 
 And they tell me you're great 
 Now let me introduce to you 
 The one and only Billy Shears 
 Ah, she's thirty-two 
 And all she wants to do, is boogaloo! 
 Hey! 
 Hey, hey, hey, hear them say 
 My mama told me I was great 
 Ho! Ho! Ho! 
 -"Let's go again, go straight from thee top 
 Okay, oh, that's okay... bang... two, three, four!"
