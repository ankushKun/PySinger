You might remember this better than I do, actually. 
 -Okay? ...something about a flat top that's all I know... 
 One, two, ah-one, two, three, four- 
 (Shhhoop-) 
 Here come ol' flat top, he come groovin' up slowly 
 He got joo joo eyeball, he one holy roller 
 He got hair down to his knees 
 Got to be a joker 'cause he's so hard to please 
 (Shhhoop- shhhoop- shhhoop- shhhoop-) 
 He wear no shoeshine, he got walrus gumboot 
 He got monkey finger, he shoot cola cola 
 He say I know you, you know me 
 One thing I can tell you is you got to be free 
 Come together, right now 
 Over you 
 ( 
 Just for a change... 
 ) 
 (Shhhoop-) 
 He bag production, he got ono sideboard 
 He one spinal cracker, he got early walkers 
 He say hair, belief, under his knees 
 Hold you in his arms till you can feel his disease 
 Come together, right now 
 Over me 
 -Oww! 
 He roller coaster, he got early warning 
 He got muddy water, he want mucho filter 
 He say one and one and one is three 
 Got to be good lookin' 'cause he's so hard to see 
 Come together, right now 
 Over me... over you... over there...(shhhoop-) 
 Come together, -ah, come together, -ay! 
 -Thank you, thank you... I nearly got all the words right too! 
 I, uh, I'll have to stop writin' those daft words, man... 
 -I don't know what I'm sayin'!
