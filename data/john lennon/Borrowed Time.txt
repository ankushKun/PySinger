When I was younger 
 Living confusion and deep despair 
 When I was younger 
 Living illusion of freedom and power 
 When I was younger 
 Full of ideals and broken dreams (my friend) 
 When I was younger 
 Everything simple but not so clear 
 Living on borrowed time 
 Without a thought for tomorrow 
 Living on borrowed time 
 Without a thought for tomorrow 
 Now I am older 
 The more that I see the less that I know for sure 
 Now I am older 
 The future is brighter and now is the hour 
 Living on borrowed time 
 Without a thought for tomorrow 
 Living on borrowed time 
 Without a thought for tomorrow 
 Good to be older 
 Would not exchange a single day or a year 
 Good to be older 
 Less complications everything clear 
 Living on borrowed time 
 Without a thought for tomorrow 
 Living on borrowed time 
 Without a thought for tomorrow
