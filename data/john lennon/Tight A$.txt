Just as tight a$ you can make it 
 Hard and slow ain't hard enough 
 Just tight a$ you can shake it, girl 
 Get it on and do your stuff 
 Tight a$ you can get it 
 Tight a$ got it made 
 Uptight's alright but if ya can't stand the heat 
 You better get back in the shade 
 Just tight a$ an Indian rope trick 
 Long and tough ain't hard enough 
 Just as tight a$ a dope fiend's fix my friend 
 Get it up and do your stuff 
 Tight a$ you can boogie 
 Tight a$ got it made 
 Uptight alright's alright but if ya can't stand the heat 
 You better get back in the shade 
 Well tight a$ got me concerned 
 Tight a$ got me laid 
 Tight a$ strut your stuff so tough 
 Just sweating in the midnight shade...
