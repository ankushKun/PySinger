Dear John 
 Don't be hard on yourself 
 Give yourself a break 
 Life wasn't meant to be run 
 The race is over, you've won 
 Dear John 
 Don't be hard on yourself 
 Give yourself a break 
 Life wasn't meant to be run 
 The race is over, you've won 
 Ha da doo-doo-doo-doo 
 Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo 
 (Laugh) 
 Dear John 
 Don't be hard on yourself 
 Give yourself a break 
 Life wasn't meant to be run 
 The race is over 
 (Whistle) 
 And dear John 
 Put the TV on, have a snack 
 Wash your mother's back 
 The race is over
