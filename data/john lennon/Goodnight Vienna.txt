..Last night, ah-hah-hah 
 She was so beautiful, she made me uptight, ah-hah-hah 
 -Oh gee! I'm worn out! Can we try another, can you hear what he's saying? 
 I took my baby to a party last night, ah-hah-hah 
 She was so beautiful, she made me uptight, ah-hah-hah 
 Up come a butcher with her ju jus alight, ah-hah-hah 
 It's all da-da-da-down to goodnight Vienna 
 Felt like a bohunk but I kept up my cool, ah-hah-hah 
 Green as a frog, man, I was back into school, ah-hah-hah 
 Zipped up my mouth 'cause I was starting to drool, ah-hah-hah 
 It's all da-da-da-down to goodnight Vienna 
 Git it up! 
 Git it up! 
 Git it up! 
 Git it up! 
 It's all da-da-da-down to goodnight Vienna 
 She said she loved me but I knew she was lying, ah-hah-hah 
 Felt like an Arab who was dancing through Zion, ah-hah-hah 
 Don't call no doctor when you just feel like crying, ah-hah-hah 
 It's all da-da-da-down to goodnight Vienna 
 Uhuh- 
 Git it up! 
 Git it up! 
 Git it up! 
 Git it up! 
 I took my baby to a party last night, ah-hah-hah 
 She was so beautiful, it made me uptight, ah-hah-hah 
 Up came a doct-- oh...
