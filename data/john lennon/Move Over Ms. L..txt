One, two, a one, two, three, four 
 Well, now the underground and overjoyed, they come on just the same 
 Don't wanna get too real, man, they just wanna play the game 
 I guess ya knew it all along, we were just singing in the rain 
 Can't get hipped to the down trip, the ship is sailing yet 
 And if it sinks, you know that all we really get is wet 
 Move over Ms. L. 
 You know I wish you well 
 Move over Ms. L. 
 You know I wish you well 
 Move over Ms. L. 
 Well, now to err is something human and forgiving so divine 
 I'll forgive your trespasses if you forgive me mine 
 Life's a deal, you knew it, when you signed the dotted line 
 They nail you to the paper, put a rope around your neck 
 And so we sing along, the boy stood on the burning deck 
 Move over Ms. L. 
 You know I wish you well 
 Move over Ms. L. 
 You know I wish you well 
 Move over Ms. L. 
 Well now, momma poppa told me, "Son, you better watch your head" 
 Your head is fulla snakes, boy, you're better red than dead 
 They're starving back in China, boy, that's what they always said 
 Can't get head in the head shop, yer jeans are fulla crap 
 You're full of beans, you're in your teens, you lost your momma's road map 
 Move over Ms. L. 
 You know I wish you well 
 Move over Ms. L. 
 You know I wish you well 
 Move over Ms. L. 
 Hey hey
