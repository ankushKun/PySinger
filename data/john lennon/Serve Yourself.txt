You say you found Jesus ( 
 Christ. 
 ) 
 He's the only one 
 You say you found Buddha 
 Sittin' in the sun 
 You say you found Mohammed 
 Facin' to the East 
 You say you found Krishna 
 Dancin' in the streets 
 Well, there's somethin' missing in this God Almighty stew 
 And it's your mother ( 
 Your mother, don't forget your mother, lad. 
 ) 
 You got to serve yourself 
 Nobody gonna do it for you 
 You got to serve yourself 
 Nobody gonna do it for you 
 Well, you may believe in devils 
 And you may believe in lords 
 ( 
 But if you don't go out and serve yourself, lad. Ain't no room service here. Think of your poor old mom in the kitchen for Christssake. 
 ) 
 It's still the same old story 
 A bloody Holy War 
 A fight for love and glory 
 Ain't gonna study war no more 
 A fight for God and country 
 We're gonna set you free 
 We'll put you back in the Stone Age 
 If you won't be like me ( 
 Get it? 
 ) 
 You got to serve yourself 
 Ain't nobody gonna do for you 
 You got to serve yourself 
 Ain't nobody gonna do for you 
 Well, you may believe in devils 
 And you may believe in lords 
 ( 
 But Christ, you're gonna have to serve yourself, and that's all there is to it. So get right back here, and it's in the bloody fridge. God, when I was a kid! Didn't have stuff like this, TV fuckin' dinners and all that crap. You fuckin' kids all the fuckin' same! Want a fuckin' car now! Lucky to have a pair of shoes! 
 ) 
 You tell me you found Jesus Christ 
 Well, that's great, and he's the only one 
 You say you just found Buddha 
 And he's sittin' on his ass in the sun 
 You say you found Mohammed 
 Kneelin' on a bloody carpet facin' East 
 You say you found Krishna 
 With a bald head dancin' in the street 
 ( 
 Well, Christ, now you're going out, you're being heard. 
 ) 
 You got to serve yourself 
 Ain't nobody gonna do for you 
 ( 
 That's right, lad, you better get that straight through your fuckin' head. 
 ) 
 You got to serve yourself 
 ( 
 You know that better, who the hell else is gonna do it for you? It ain't me, kid, I tell you that. 
 ) 
 Well, you may believe in Jesus 
 And you may believe in Marx 
 And you may believe in Marks and Spencer 
 And you may believe in bloody Woolworths 
 But there's something missing in this whole bloody stew 
 And it's your mother 
 Your poor bloody mother 
 ( 
 She what born you in the back bedroom, full of piss and shit and fuckin' midwives. God, you can't forget that all too quick, you know. You should have been in the bloody war, lad, and you would have known all about it. Well, I'll tell you something. 
 ) 
 It's still the same old story 
 A Holy bloody War ( 
 You know, the Pope and all that stuff. 
 ) 
 A fight for love and glory 
 Ain't gonna study no war more war 
 A fight for God and country ( 
 The Queen and all that. 
 ) 
 We're gonna set you free ( 
 Yeah, well, sure. 
 ) 
 We'll bomb you back into the fuckin' Stone Age 
 If you won't do like me ( 
 You know, get on your knees and pray. 
 ) 
 ( 
 Well, there's somethin' missing in this God Almighty stew, and it's your goddamn mother you dirty little git. Now get in there and wash yer ears! 
 )
