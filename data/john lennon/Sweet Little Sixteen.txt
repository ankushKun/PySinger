Whoa 
 They're really rockin' in Boston 
 In Pittsburgh, P.A. 
 Deep in the heart of Texas 
 On down the 'Frisco Bay 
 All over Saint Louis 
 And down in New Orleans 
 All the cats want to dance with 
 Sweet little sixteen 
 Sweet little sixteen 
 She's got the grown up blues 
 Tight dresses and lipstick 
 She's sportin' high heeled boots 
 Oh, but tomorrow morning 
 She's gonna have to change her trend 
 Become sweet sixteen 
 And back in class again 
 Oh mommy, mommy 
 Please, please, may I go? 
 You know it's such a sight to see them 
 Somebody steal the show 
 Oh, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy 
 You know I beg of you 
 Scream it to mama 
 It's alright with you 
 Because they're rockin' in New York 
 In Philadelphia, P.A. 
 Deep in the heart of Texas 
 Down the Rainbow, L.A. 
 All over Saint Louis 
 And down in New Orleans 
 All the mothers wanna to 
 Be sweet little sixteen 
 Sweet sweet sweet sixteen 
 She's so delicate 
 She's just got to have it 
 About half 
 Half a million
