There may not be much difference 
 Between Chairman Mao and Richard Nixon 
 If we strip them naked 
 There may not be much difference 
 Between Marilyn Monroe and Lenny Bruce 
 If we check their coffins 
 There may not be much difference 
 Between White House and Hall of People 
 If we count their windows 
 There may not be much difference 
 Between Raquel Welch and Jerry Rubin 
 If we hear their heartbeat 
 We're all water from different rivers 
 That's why it's so easy to meet 
 We're all water in this vast, vast ocean 
 Someday we'll evaporate together 
 There may not be much difference 
 Between Eldrige Cleaver and Queen of England 
 If we bottle their tears 
 There may not be much difference 
 Between Manson and the Pope 
 If we press their smile 
 There may not be much difference 
 Between Rockefeller and you 
 If we hear you sing 
 There may not be much difference 
 Between you and me 
 If we show our dreams 
 We're all water from different rivers 
 That's why it's so easy to meet 
 We're all water in this vast, vast ocean 
 Someday we'll evaporate together 
 What's the difference? 
 What's the difference? 
 There's no difference 
 There's no difference 
 What's the difference?
