What a waste of human 
 Power 
 What a waste of human lives, 
 Shoot the prisioners in 
 The towers 
 Forthy-three poor widowed 
 Wives 
 Media blames it on the 
 Prisioners, 
 But the prisioners did not kill 
 "Rockefeller pulled the trigger" 
 That's what the people feel. 
 Attica, Attica state, we're all 
 Mates with Attica state. 
 Free the prisioners, free 
 The judges 
 Free all the prisioners everywhere, 
 All they want is truth 
 And justice 
 All they need is love and care 
 They all live in suffocation, 
 Let's not wathc them die 
 In sorrow, 
 Now's the time for revolution, 
 Give them all chance to grow. 
 Attica state... 
 Come together join the movement, 
 Take a stand for human rights, 
 Fear and hatred clouds 
 Our judgement, 
 Free us all from endless 
 Night, 
 Attica state... 
 We are all mattes... 
 We all live in... 
 Attica, Attica, Attica state.
