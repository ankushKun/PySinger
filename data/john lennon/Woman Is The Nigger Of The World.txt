Woman is the n***** of the world 
 Yes, she is, think about it 
 Woman is the n***** of the world 
 Think about it, do something about it 
 We make her paint her face and dance 
 If she won't be a slave, we say that she don't love us 
 If she's real, we say she's trying to be a man 
 While putting her down we pretend that she's above us 
 Woman is the n***** of the world, yes, she is 
 If you don't believe me, take a look at the one you're with 
 Woman is the slave of the slaves 
 Oh yeah, you better scream about it, yeah 
 We make her bear and raise our children 
 And then we leave her flat for being a fat old mother hen 
 We tell her home is the only place she should be 
 Then we complain that she's too unworldly to be our friend 
 Woman is the n***** of the world, yes, she is 
 If you don't believe me, take a look at the one you're with 
 Woman is the slave to the slave 
 Yeah, alright, hit it 
 We insult her every day on TV 
 And wonder why she has no guts or confidence 
 When she's young, we kill her will to be free 
 While telling her not to be so smart we put her down for being so dumb 
 Woman is the n***** of the world, yes, she is 
 If you don't believe me, take a look at the one you're with 
 Woman is the slave to the slaves, yes, she is 
 If you believe me, you better scream about it 
 We make her paint her face and dance
