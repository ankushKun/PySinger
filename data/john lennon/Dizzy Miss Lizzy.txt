You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, 
 The way you rock'n'roll. 
 You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, 
 When we do the stroll. 
 Come on, Miss Lizzy, 
 Love me fore I grow too old. 
 Come on, give me fever, 
 Put your little hand in mine. 
 You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, 
 Girl, you look so fine. 
 You're just a-rockin' and a-rollin', 
 I sure do wish you were mine. 
 You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, 
 When you call my name. 
 O-o-o-o-oh baby, 
 Say you're driving me insane. 
 Come on, come on, come on, baby, 
 I want to be your lover man. 
 Run and tell your mama 
 I want you to be my bride. 
 Run and tell your brother, 
 Baby, don't run and hide. 
 You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, 
 And I want to marry you. 
 Come on, give me fever, 
 Put your little hand in mine. 
 You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, 
 Girl, you look so fine. 
 You're just a-rockin' and.a-rollin', 
 I sure do wish you were mine
