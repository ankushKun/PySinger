Lord, take this makeup of off of me 
 I said, "Lordy, lordy, lordy, take this makeup offa me" 
 It's bad enough on the beach 
 But it's worse in the sea 
 Because I'm knockin' on heaven's door 
 Because I'm lookin' for my ma 
 I said, "Ma, take these guns away from me" 
 I said, "Ma, take these guns away from me" 
 I got so thin now, they're draggin' me down to my knees 
 Oh yeah, man, do you Mr. Jones? 
 Town 
 Now I've been here so long, I almost forgot my name 
 I said, "Lord I been here so long I almost forgot my name" 
 But as long as I keep touring 
 I'll always be in the game, fame, brain, shame and fame and game, fame, fame
