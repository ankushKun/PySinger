Imagine there's no heaven 
 It's easy if you try 
 No hell below us 
 Above us only sky 
 Imagine all the people living for today 
 Imagine there's no countries 
 It isn't hard to do 
 Nothing to kill or die for 
 No religion too 
 Imagine all the people living life in peace 
 You may say 
 I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one 
 I hope some day you'll join us 
 And the world will live as one 
 Imagine no possessions 
 I wonder if you can 
 No need for greed or hunger 
 A brotherhood of man 
 Imagine all the people sharing all the world 
 You may say 
 That I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one 
 I hope some day you'll join us 
 And the world will be as one
