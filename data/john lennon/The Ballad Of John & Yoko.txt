Standing on the dock at Southampton 
 Trying to get to Holland or France 
 The man in the Mac 
 Said, "You've gotta go back" 
 You know, they didn't even give us a chance 
 Christ, you know it ain't easy 
 You know how hard it can be 
 The way things are going 
 They're gonna crucify me 
 Finally made the plane into Paris 
 Honeymooning down by the Seine 
 Peter Brown called to say 
 "You can make it okay 
 "You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain" 
 Christ, you know it ain't easy 
 You know how hard it can be 
 The way things are going 
 They're gonna crucify me 
 Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton 
 Talking in our beds for a week 
 The newspeople said 
 "Say, what're you doing in bed?" 
 I said, "we're only trying to get us some peace" 
 Christ, you know it ain't easy 
 You know how hard it can be 
 The way things are going 
 They're gonna crucify me 
 Savin' up yer money for a rainy day 
 Givin' all yer clothes to charity 
 Last night the wife said 
 Oh boy when you're dead 
 You don't take nothin' with ya but your soul 
 Made a lightning trip to Vienna 
 Eating chocolate cake in a bag 
 The newspaper said 
 "She's gone to his head 
 "They look just like two gurus in drag" 
 Christ, you know it ain't easy 
 You know how hard it can be 
 The way things are going 
 They're gonna crucify me 
 Caught the early plane back to London 
 Fifty acrons tied in a sack 
 The men from the press 
 Said, "we wish you success 
 "It's good to have the both of you back" 
 Christ, you know it ain't easy 
 You know how hard it can be 
 The way things are going 
 They're gonna crucify me 
 The way things are going 
 They're gonna crucify me 
 The way things are going 
 They're gonna crucify me
