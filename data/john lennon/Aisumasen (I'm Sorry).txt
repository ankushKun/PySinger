When I'm down, really yin 
 And I don't know what I'm doing 
 Aisumasen, aisumasen Yoko 
 All I had to do was call your name 
 All I had to do was call your name 
 And when I hurt you and cause you pain 
 Darlin' I promise I won't do it again 
 Aisumasen, aisumasen Yoko 
 It's hard enough I know just to feel your own pain 
 It's hard enough I know to feel, feel your own pain 
 All that I know is just what you tell me 
 All that I know is just what you show me 
 When I'm down, real sanpaku 
 And I don't know what to do 
 Aisumasen, aisumasen Yoko san 
 All I had to do was call your name 
 Yes, all I had to do was call your name
