You are my weakness 
 You are my strength 
 Nothing I have in the world 
 Makes better sense 
 'Cause I'm the fish and you're the sea. 
 When we're together 
 Or when we're apart 
 There's never a space in between 
 The beat of our hearts 
 'Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree. 
 One day a time is all we do 
 One day at a time is good for you 
 (Yeah) you (yeah) you (yeah) you. 
 You are my woman 
 I am your man 
 Nothing else matters at all, 
 Now I understand 
 That I'm the door and you're the key. 
 And every morning 
 I wake in your smile 
 Feeling your breath on my face 
 And in the love in your eyes 
 'Cause you're the honey and I'm the bee. 
 One day at a time is all we do 
 One day at a time is good for us two 
 (Yeah) us two (yeah) us two (yeah) you.
