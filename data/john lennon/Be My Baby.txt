The night we met I knew I needed you so 
 And if I had the chance I'd never let you go 
 So won't you say you love me 
 I'll make you so proud of me 
 We'll make them turn their heads every place we go 
 So won't you please 
 (Be my be my baby) 
 Be my little baby 
 (My one and only baby) 
 Say you'll be my darling 
 (Be my be my baby) 
 Be my baby now oh oh oh oh 
 I'll make you happy baby just wait and see 
 And for every kiss you give me I'm gonna give you three 
 Since the day I saw you 
 You know I was waiting for you 
 You know I will adore till eternity 
 So won't you please 
 (Be my be my baby) 
 Be my little baby 
 (My one and only baby) 
 Say you'll be my darling 
 (Be my be my baby) 
 Be my baby now oh oh oh oh 
 Instrumental 
 Since the day I saw you 
 You know I was waiting for you 
 You know I will adore till eternity 
 So won't you please 
 (Be my be my baby) 
 Be my little baby 
 (My one and only baby) 
 Say you'll be my darling 
 (Be my be my baby) 
 Be my baby now oh oh oh oh
