This here's the story about a house husband 
 Who, you know, just has to get out of the house 
 He's been looking at the, you know, the kids for days and days 
 He's been washing the dishes and screwing around and watching Sesame Street 
 'Til he's gone crazy 
 Woke up this morning, blues around my head 
 No need to ask the reason why 
 Went to the kitchen and lit a cigarette 
 Blew my worries to the sky 
 I'm steppin' out 
 I'm steppin' out 
 I'm steppin' out 
 I'm steppin' out, yeah 
 If it don't feel right, you don't have to do it 
 Just leave a message on the phone and tell them to screw it 
 After all is said and done you can't go pleasin' everyone 
 So screw it 
 I'm steppin' out 
 I'm steppin' out 
 I'm steppin' out, baby 
 I'm steppin' out 
 Baby's sleeping, the cats have all been blessed 
 Ain't nothing doing on TV, summer repeats 
 Put on my space suit, I got to look my best 
 I'm going out to do the city 
 I'm steppin' out 
 I'm steppin' out 
 I'm steppin' out, babe 
 I'm steppin' out 
 Boogie 
 One more 
 I'm steppin' out 
 Hold it down 
 I'm steppin' out 
 I'm steppin' out 
 Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta get out 
 I'm steppin' out, babe 
 Just awhile 
 Ain't been out for days 
 Got to do it tonight 
 Gimme a break, gimme a break 
 Gotta get out 
 Gotta get out 
 Just for awhile, just for the night 
 I'll be in before one or two
