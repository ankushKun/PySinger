- "Okay, but we like to, we like to have those things on record" 
 - "Yeah, right" 
 - "Let's not get so hysterical this time" 
 - "No" 
 My life, take it, it's mine to give 
 Take it, let me live in you 
 My life, take it, it's yours 
 Do what you will, I dedicate it to you 
 What's the use in waking 
 If you're not there to share the dreams and nightmares? 
 My life, take it, for better or worse 
 Why waste time? 
 We both know together is the only way 
 We'll make it any way 
 Take it, my life 
 My life is you 
 What's the use in waking 
 If you're not there to share the dreams and nightmares? 
 I've only myself to 
 I've only myself to (Give to) you 
 My life, take it, for better or worse 
 Why waste time? 
 When we both know together is the only way 
 We're gonna make it any way 
 Take it, my life 
 My life is you
