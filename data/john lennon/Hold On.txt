Hold on John 
 John hold on 
 It's gonna be alright 
 You're gonna win the fight 
 Hold on Yoko 
 Yoko hold on 
 It's going to be alright 
 You're going to make the flight 
 When you're by yourself 
 And there's no one else 
 You just have yourself 
 And you tell yourself 
 Just to hold on 
 Cookie 
 Hold on world 
 World hold on 
 It's going to be alright 
 You're going to see the light 
 And when you're one 
 Really one 
 Well you get things done 
 Like they've never been done 
 So hold on
