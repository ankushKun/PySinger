So 
 Sgt. Pepper 
 took you by surprise 
 You better see right through that mother's eyes 
 Those freaks was right when they said you was dead 
 The one mistake you made was in your head 
 Tell me, how do you sleep? 
 Tell me, how do you sleep at night? 
 You live with straights who tell you you was king 
 Jump when your mama tell you anything 
 The only thing you done was 
 Yesterday 
 And since you've gone, you're just 
 Another Day 
 Tell me, how do you sleep at night? 
 Tell me, how do you sleep at night? 
 Ah, how do you sleep at night? 
 A pretty face may last a year or two 
 But pretty soon, they'll see what you can do 
 The sound you make is Muzak to my ears 
 You must have learned something in all those years 
 Ah, how do you sleep, brother? 
 Ah, tell me, how do you sleep at night?
