You are my weakness 
 You are my strength 
 Nothing I have in the world 
 Makes better sense 
 'Cause I'm a fish and you're the sea 
 When we're together 
 When we're apart 
 There's never a beat in between 
 The beat of our hearts 
 'Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree 
 (Toot-toot-toot) 
 One day at a time is all we do-be doo 
 One day at a time is good for 
 You 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Oh-oh 
 You are my woman 
 I am your man 
 Nothing else matters at all 
 Now I understand 
 That I'm the door and you're the key 
 And ev'ry morning 
 I wake in your smile 
 Feeling your breath on my face 
 And the love in your eyes 
 'Cause you're the honey and I'm the bee 
 (Toot-toot-toot) 
 One day at a time is all we do-be-doo-be-doo 
 One day at a time is good for 
 You 
 Us two 
 You too 
 Oh-oh 
 Do do do do 
 Do do do do 
 Do do do do do do 
 Do do do do 
 'Cause I'm the fish and you're the sea 
 'Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree 
 'Cause I'm the door and you're the key 
 'Cause I'm a honey and you're the bee
