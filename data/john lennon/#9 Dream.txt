So long ago 
 Was it in a dream 
 Was it just a dream 
 I know, yes I know 
 Seemed so very real 
 It seemed so real to me 
 Took a walk down the street 
 Through the heat whispered trees 
 I thought I could hear, hear, hear, hear 
 Somebody call out my name (John) 
 As it started to rain (John) 
 Two spirits dancing so strange 
 Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè 
 Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè 
 Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè 
 Dream, dream away 
 Magic in the air 
 Was magic in the air 
 I believe, yes I believe 
 More I cannot say 
 What more can I say 
 On a river of sound 
 Through the mirror I go 'round, 'round 
 I thought I could feel, feel, feel, feel 
 Music touching my soul (nhoJ) 
 Something warm sudden cold (nhoJ) 
 The spirit dance was unfolding 
 Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè 
 Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè 
 Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè 
 Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè ...
