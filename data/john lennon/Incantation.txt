 Incantation 
 (Ooh, ooh, ooh) 
 Incantation 
 (Ooh, ooh, ooh) 
 If ya ever meet the sweet rolling thunder 
 (Flying on the dead of the night) 
 Just call me if ya can't get his number 
 (Watching how that rattlesnake bites) 
 All he's got is real understanding 
 Smokin' through his medicine head 
 Watch him get down to the unreal voodoo 
 And shove it to the living dead 
 Incantation 
 (Ooh, ooh, ooh) 
 Incantation 
 (Ooh, ooh, ooh) 
 What's happenin',' found his face in a bad dream, momma? 
 (Flying on the dead of the night) 
 I woke up and then I let out a bad scream, ooh! 
 (Watching how that rattlesnake bites) 
 Rolling thunder said, "Ya got this one started" 
 What happened there, did the kid get high, high? 
 All the dog soldiers shootin' uncoke-a-cola 
 Get 'em dancin' till they lose their minds 
 Incantation 
 (Ooh, ooh, ooh) 
 Ah, yeah!

 (Ooh, ooh, ooh) 
 Shh! Rattlesnake, buddy! 
 (Watching how the rattlesnake bites)
