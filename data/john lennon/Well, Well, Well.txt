I took my loved one out to dinner 
 So we could get a bite to eat 
 And though we both had been much thinner 
 She looked so beautiful I could eat her 
 Well Well Well Oh Well 
 We sat and talked of revolution 
 Just like to librals in the sun 
 We talked of womens liberation 
 And how the hell we could get thing done 
 Well Well Well Oh Well 
 I took my loved one to a big field 
 So we could watch the English sky 
 Were both feeling guilty 
 And neither one of us knew just why 
 Well Well Well Oh Well
