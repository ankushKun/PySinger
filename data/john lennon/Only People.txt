Only people know just how to talk to people 
 Only people know just how to change the world 
 Only people realize the power of people 
 Well, a million heads are better than one 
 So come on, get it on! 
 Well I know how we tried and the millions of tears that we cried 
 Now we are hipper we been through the trip 
 And we can't be denied with woman and man side by side 
 Make no mistake it's our future we're making 
 Bake the cake and eat it too! 
 We don't want no pig brother scene! 
 Only people know just how to talk to people 
 Only people know just how to change the world 
 Only people realize the power of people 
 Well, a million heads are better than one 
 So come on, get it on! 
 We'll it's long overdue there ain't nothing better to do 
 Now we are hipper we been through the trip 
 We can fly right on through, there's nothing on earth we can't do 
 Fish or cut bait it's our future we're making 
 All together now pull the chain 
 We don't want no pig brother scene! 
 Only people know just how to talk to people 
 Only people know just how to change the world
