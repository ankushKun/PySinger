Hey 
 Sweet as the smell of success 
 Her body's warm and wet 
 She gets me through this god awful loneliness 
 A natural high butterfly, oh I 
 I need, need, need her 
 Just like a willow tree 
 A breath of spring you see 
 And, oh boy, you don't know what she do to me 
 She makes me sweat and forget who I am 
 I need, need, need, need, need her 
 Well I was wondering how long 
 This could go on, on and on 
 Well I thought I could never be surprised 
 But could it be that I bit my own tongue, oh yeah 
 It's so hard to swallow when you're wrong 
 A bird of paradise 
 The sunrise in her eyes 
 God only knows such a sweet surprise 
 I was blind she blew my mind think that I 
 I love, love, love, love, love her 
 I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her 
 Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love 
 Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love 
 Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love 
 Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love 
 Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love 
 Ah yeah 
 Ah yeah
