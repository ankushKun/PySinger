I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine 
 Wonderful, wonderful 
 Do the other way, two, three, four 
 Nobody loves you when you're down and out 
 Nobody sees you when you're on cloud nine 
 Everybody's hustlin' for a buck and a dime 
 I'll scratch your back and you scratch mine 
 I've been across to the other side 
 I've shown you everything, I got nothing to hide 
 But still you ask me, do I love you, what it is, what it is 
 All I can tell you is it's all show biz 
 All I can tell you is it's all show biz 
 What it is, what it is, what it is, what it is 
 Nobody loves you when you're down and out 
 Nobody knows you when you're on cloud nine 
 Everybody's hustlin' for a buck and a dime 
 I'll scratch your back and you knife mine 
 I've been across the water now so many times 
 I've seen the one-eyed witch doctor leading the blind 
 But still you ask me, do I love you, what you say, what you say 
 Every time I put my finger on it, it slips away 
 Every time I put my finger on it, it slips away 
 What you say, what you say, what you say, what you say 
 Well, I get up in the morning 
 And I'm looking in the mirror to see, ooh, ooh, yeah 
 Then I'm lying in the darkness 
 And I know, I can't get to sleep, ooh, ooh, yeah 
 One, two, three, four 
 Nobody loves you when you're old and gray 
 Nobody needs you when you're upside down 
 Everybody's hollerin' 'bout their own birthday 
 Everybody loves you when you're six foot in the ground
