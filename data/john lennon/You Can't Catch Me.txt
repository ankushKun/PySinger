I bought a brand new airmobile 
 'Twas a custom made, 'twas a flightning deal 
 With a powerful motor and a hide away wing 
 Push in on the button, you will hear her sing 
 Now, you can't catch me 
 Baby, you can't catch me 
 'Cause if you get too close 
 You know I'm goin' like cool breeze 
 Hey, hey 
 Well, you walk 
 You walk 
 New Jersey turnpike in the wee wee hours 
 I was rollin' slowly 'cause of drizzlin' showers 
 Here come a flat-top, he was movin' up with me 
 Then come waving goodbye in a souped up jitney 
 I put my foot in the tank, I began to roll 
 Moanin' siren, 'twas the state patrol 
 I let out my wings, then I blew my horn 
 Bye-bye, New Jersey, I become airborn 
 You can't catch me 
 Baby, you can't catch me 
 'Cause if you get too close 
 You know I'm goin' like cool breeze 
 Hey 
 Well, you walk 
 Yeah, walk

 Hey, hey 
 Well, you walk 
 You walk 
 Flying with my baby last Saturday night 
 Wasn't a grey cloud floatin' in sight 
 Big, full moon, shinin' up above 
 Cuddle up, honey, be my love 
 Sweetest little thing that I ever seen 
 I'm gonna name you Maybellene 
 Flying on the beam, set on flight control 
 Radio tuned to rock and roll 
 Two, three hours passed us by 
 Altitude dropped into five-oh-five 
 Fuel consumption, way too fast 
 Let's get on home before we run out of gas 
 Now, you can't catch me 
 Baby, you can't catch me 
 'Cause if you get too close 
 You know I'm goin' like cool breeze 
 Git it on 
 Yeah, walk 
 Git it on 
 Git it on, git it on, do it 
 Git it on, git it on 
 You know you can't catch me
