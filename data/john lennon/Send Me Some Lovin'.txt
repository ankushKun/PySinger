Send me some lovin', 
 Send it I pray. 
 How can I love you 
 When you're so far away? 
 Send me your picture, 
 Send it, my dear. 
 So I can hold it 
 And pretend you are here. 
 Send me your kisses, 
 I can feel your touch. 
 I need you, I need you so badly, 
 Don't you know I miss you so much? 
 My days are so lonely, 
 My nights are so blue. 
 I'm here and I'm lonely, 
 Just waitin' for you
