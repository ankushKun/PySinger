God is a concept, 
 By which we can measure, 
 Our pain, 
 I'll say it again, 
 God is a concept, 
 By which we can measure, 
 Our pain, 
 I don't believe in magic, 
 I don't believe in I-ching, 
 I don't believe in bible, 
 I don't believe in tarot, 
 I don't believe in Hitler, 
 I don't believe in Jesus, 
 I don't believe in Kennedy, 
 I don't believe in Buddha, 
 I don't believe in mantra, 
 I don't believe in Gita, 
 I don't believe in yoga, 
 I don't believe in kings, 
 I don't believe in Elvis, 
 I don't believe in Zimmerman, 
 I don't believe in Beatles, 
 I just believe in me, 
 Yoko and me, 
 And that's reality. 
 The dream is over, 
 What can I say? 
 The dream is over, 
 Yesterday, 
 I was dreamweaver, 
 But now I'm reborn, 
 I was the walrus, 
 But now I'm John, 
 And so dear friends, 
 You just have to carry on, 
 The dream is over.
