Oh, dirty Maggie Mae 
 They have taken her away 
 And she'll never walk down Lime Street any more 
 Oh, the judge he guilty found her 
 Of robbin' the homeward bounder 
 That dirty, no good, robbin' Maggie Mae 
 'Tis the part of Liverpool 
 North of Liverpool 
 Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay 
 Oh, something down 
 Went down on number nine 
 T'was down in Kelly's porn shop, number nine 
 Oh, dirty Maggie Mae 
 They have taken her away 
 And she'll never walk down Lime Street any more 
 Oh, the judge he guilty found her
