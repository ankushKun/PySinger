Mount Elga, Mount Elga 
 A high mountain 
 I climb as I'm dreaming, a-huh 
 Mount Elga, Mount Elga 
 A high mountain 
 I climb as I'm dreaming 
 Catching me hell 
 To climb this hill 
 The more I try to climb 
 I'm slipping still 
 Me body run down 
 Me feeling weak 
 The more I try to climb up 
 This mountain peak
