I'm sick and tired of hearing things 
 From uptight, short-sighted, narrow-minded hypocritics 
 All I want is the truth 
 Just gimme some truth 
 I've had enough of reading things 
 By neurotic, psychotic, pig-headed politicians 
 All I want is the truth 
 Just gimme some truth 
 No short-haired, yellow-bellied, son of Tricky Dick 
 Is gonna Mother Hubbard soft soap me 
 For just a pocketful of hope 
 Money for dope 
 Money for rope 
 Woo hoo 
 No short-haired, yellow-bellied, son of Tricky Dick 
 Is gonna Mother Hubbard soft soap me 
 With just a pocketful of soap 
 Money for dope 
 Money for rope 
 I'm sick to death of seeing things 
 From tight-lipped, condescending, mama's little chauvinists 
 All I want is the truth, 
 Just gimme some truth, now 
 I've had enough of watching scenes 
 With schizophrenic, ego-centric, paranoiac prima-donnas 
 All I want is the truth now, now 
 Just gimme some truth 
 No short-haired, yellow-bellied, son of Tricky Dick 
 Is gonna Mother Hubbard soft soap me 
 With just a pocketful of soap 
 It's money for dope 
 Money for rope 
 Ah, I'm sick to death of peering things 
 From uptight, short-sighted, narrow-minded hypocrites 
 All I want is the truth, now 
 Just gimme some truth, now 
 I've had enough of reading things 
 By neurotic, psychotic, pig-headed politicians 
 All I want is the truth, now 
 Just gimme some truth, now 
 All I want is the truth, now 
 Just gimme some truth, now 
 All I want is the truth 
 Just gimme some truth 
 All I want is the truth 
 Just gimme some truth
