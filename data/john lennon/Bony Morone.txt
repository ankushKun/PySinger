I got a girl named Bony Morone 
 She's as skinny as a stick of macaroni 
 Ought to see her rock and roll with her blue jeans on 
 She's not very fat, just skin and bones. 
 I love her and she loves me. Oh how happy now we can be, 
 Making love underneath the apple tree. 
 Well, I told her mama and her papa too 
 Just exactly what I wanna do 
 I wanna get married on a night in June 
 And rock and roll by the light of the silvery moon 
 She's my one and only, she's my heart's desire 
 She's a real upsetter, she's a real live wire 
 Everyone turns when my baby walks by, 
 She's something to see, really catches the eye
