Justin Bieber 
 With you 
 With you 
 I wish we had another time 
 I wish we had another place 
 Tyga 
 Ugh, this is kinda how my heart sounds 
 Every beat like a image in the background 
 I'm sitting here, thinking where is you now 
 I wanna tell you but there's too many people round 
 You know I love you, I care but it's unfair 
 I ain't perfect but I'm tryna be the best I can 
 If it's real than its gon' come back again 
 So I'm letting go, I hope you understand 
 All your friends say, he don't love you 
 And the grown ups say it's puppy 
 Love ain't lust, it's more unlucky 
 Until you meet a diamond girl, now it's sunny 
 That I thought 
 Loving you, it was us against the world 
 You my favorite girl, for you I would go to war 
 I, take this all in just to show you 
 Or maybe I'm just stuck in the moment 
 Justin Bieber 
 Now Romeo & Juliet 
 Bet they never felt the way we felt 
 Bonnie & Clyde 
 Never had to hide like 
 We do 
 We do 
 You and I, both know it can't work 
 It's all fun and games 
 'Til someone gets hurt 
 And I don't 
 I won't let that be you 
 Now you don't wanna let go 
 And I don't wanna let you know 
 That there might be something real between us two 
 Who knew? 
 Now we don't wanna fall but 
 We're trippin' in our hearts 
 And it's reckless and clumsy 
 'Cause I know you can't love me here 
 I wish we had another time 
 I wish we had another place 
 But everything we have is stuck in the moment 
 And there's nothing my heart can do 
 To fight with time and space 'cause 
 I'm still stuck in the moment with you 
 See like Adam & Eve 
 Tragedy was our destiny 
 Like Sonny & Cher 
 I don't care 
 I got you baby 
 See we both 
 Fightin' every inch of our fibers 
 'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but 
 We are both too foolish to stop 
 Now you don't wanna let go 
 And I don't wanna let you know 
 That there might be something real between us two 
 Who knew? 
 And we don't wanna fall but 
 We're tripping in our hearts 
 And it's reckless and clumsy 
 And I know you can't love me here 
 I wish we had another time 
 I wish we had another place 
 But everything we have is stuck in the moment 
 And there's nothing my heart can do 
 To fight with time and space 'cause 
 I'm still stuck in the moment with you 
 See like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be 
 Baby we both have the right to disagree 
 And I ain't with it 
 And I don't wanna be so old and gray 
 Reminiscing 'bout these better days 
 But convince just telling us to let go 
 So we'll never know 
 I wish we had another time 
 I wish we had another place 
 'Cause everything we did 
 And everything we have is stuck in the moment 
 I wish we had another time 
 I wish we had another place 
 (Oh no no) 
 But everything we have is stuck in the moment 
 And there's nothing my heart can do 
 (Nothing my heart can do) 
 To fight with time and space 
 (And space) 
 I'm still stuck in the moment with you 
 Yeah
