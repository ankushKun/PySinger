Justin Bieber 
 Never say never 
 (never, ever) 
 Yeah yeah 
 See I never thought that I could walk through fire 
 I never thought that I could take the burn 
 I never had the strength to take it higher 
 Until I reached the point of no return 
 And there's just no turning back 
 When your heart's under attack 
 Gonna give everything I have 
 It's my destiny 
 I will never say never, I will fight 
 I will fight till forever, to make it right 
 Whenever you knock me down 
 I will not stay on the ground 
 Pick it up 
 Pick it up 
 Pick it up 
 Pick it up up up 
 And never say never 
 Ne-never say never (never) 
 Ne-never say never (never) 
 Ne-never say never (never) 
 I never thought that I could feel this power 
 I never thought that I could feel this free 
 I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower 
 And I'm fast enough to run across the sea, oh-oh 
 And there's just no turning back, oh no 
 When your heart's under attack, oh no 
 Gonna give everything I have 
 'cause this is my destiny 
 I will never say never (never say never) I will fight 
 I will fight till forever (make it right) 
 Whenever you knock me down 
 I will not stay on the ground 
 Pick it up 
 Pick it up 
 Pick it up 
 Pick it up, up, up 
 And never say never 
 Jaden Smith and Justin Bieber 
 Here we go! 
 Guess who? 
 J Smith and JB (Uh-huh!) 
 I got ya little bro 
 I can handle him 
 Hold up 
 I, I can handle him 
 Jaden Smith 
 Now he's bigger than me 
 Taller than me 
 And he's older than me 
 And stronger than me 
 And his arms a little bit longer than me 
 But he ain't on a JB song with me! 
 I be trying a chill 
 They be trying to sour the thrill 
 No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will 
 Like Luke with the force, when push comes to shove 
 Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood 
 I gotta be the best, and yes 
 We're the flyest 
 Like David and Goliath 
 I conquered the giant 
 So now I got the world in my hand 
 I was born from two stars 
 So the moon's where I land (I'm gone) 
 Jaden Smith and Justin Bieber 
 I will never say never (never say it, never, never say it) I will fight 
 I will fight till forever (okay, okay) to make it right 
 Whenever you knock me down 
 I will not stay on the ground 
 Pick it up 
 Pick it up 
 Pick it up 
 Pick it up, up, up 
 And never say never 
 Say never (never say it, never say it) 
 Say never (okay, okay) 
 Whenever you knock me down 
 I will not stay on the ground 
 Pick it up 
 Pick it up 
 Pick it up, 
 Pick it up, up, up 
 And never say never 
 Ne-never say never (never say it) 
 Ne-never say never (never say it) 
 Ne-never say never (never say it) 
 never, never, say never 
 And never say never 
 Ne-never say never (never say it) 
 Ne-never say never (no, nope, never say it) 
 Ne-never say never 
 And never say never
