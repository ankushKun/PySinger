 Baby, it's keeping me dry 
 I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat 
 You'll know exactly why 
 When the wind blows, and the sun goes away 
 And the sand fall, stormy day, 
 That's what it's for, yeah, that's what it's for, yeah 
 And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my jacket slow yeah, jacket slow yeah 
 Whenever I do have it, do I ever want this to face me 
 Whenever I do have it, do I want this thing to make me 
 Cause the fame and the money, and the girls will drive you crazy (drive you crazy) 
 And all the "He said, she said", I'm thinking maybe 
 Just put on my... 
 Guess I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat

 Well, all I gotta do is stay me 
 Let's the rest do the work and I'm sure that it'll be fine, be fine 
 When the wind blows, and the sun goes away 
 And the sand fall, stormy day, 
 That's what it's for, yeah, that's what it's for, yeah 
 And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my jacket slow yeah, jacket slow yeah 
 Whenever I do have it, do I ever want this to face me 
 Whenever I do have it, do I want this thing to make me 
 Cause the fame and the money, and the girls will drive you crazy 
 And all the "He said, she said", I'm thinking maybe
