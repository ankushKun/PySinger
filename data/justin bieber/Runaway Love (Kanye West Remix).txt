Raekwon 
 Visual visual JB 
 Yo Ye whattup 
 Raekwon 
 You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes 
 All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes 
 Palms is wet, a don's regret 
 Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck 
 It just happened I was floating, you seen the captain? 
 Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap 
 Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica 
 Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego 
 It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is 
 We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this 
 Fly walls, dining in fly halls 
 Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall 
 All my money tied in knots 
 Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks 
 Brazil cut sweater, patent leather 
 Playing the field, trying to outslick Baretta 
 Justin Bieber 
 You see my baby over here 
 Hit the road 
 Where she's going that's what nobody knows 
 I need to find her before another man does 
 I wouldn't want him to steal my love 
 I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool 
 (trying to be cool) 
 What you expect me to do? (oh yeah) 
 I'm just trying to find, find, find 
 The sweet love of mine 
 I'm running out of time 
 Where is my runaway love? 
 Searching low and high 
 Know that I'm not giving up 
 I'd give it all up for her 
 But it'll never be enough 
 I won't stop until I find 
 My runaway love 
 Kanye West 
 Last name West and my teeth diamonds 
 She said "Yo what's your occupation, crazy rhyming?" 
 Listen to Wu-Tang, trying suits on 
 Accoutrements is Grey Poupon 
 Stunting in a high top Louis', shorts is the Coogis 
 Open up the door when you take her to the movies 
 When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro 
 Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo 
 Next show they gotta up the zeros 
 Nobody rocking like this 16 years old 
 The hard drums and the Wally's something that caught me 
 I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me 
 The young youth, rocking the gold tooth 
 Pull up in a drop top, old school bumping to Cash Rules 
 No question we the reason why the summer's blazing 
 Then say, "You looking good fly coloured Asian" 
 Raw I give it to you, no trivia 
 She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia 
 Until she caught me getting numbers and hugs 
 I guess that's the day she became a runaway love, sweet love of mine 
 Justin Bieber 
 I'm running out of time 
 Where is my runaway love? 
 Searching low and high 
 Know that I'm not giving up 
 I'd give it all up for her 
 But it'll never be enough 
 I won't stop until I find 
 My runaway love 
 Why can't I find (why can't I find) you love of mine? 
 When you're standing in front of my face? 
 Oh I (oh I) I must be blind 
 How did I let you get away? (Yeah) 
 Raekwon 
 Leave it up to the most high, sitting in a ghost fly 
 Chilling with two of my brothers 
 We both live on deck grabbing 'em on set 
 This is how we roll in the business, she a go I'mma go get 
 Take that queen or shorty up 
 We can live it up every month baby girl, just call me up 
 Waking up resting in cold sweats 
 Thinking of this b*tch, the videotapes, even the stress 
 My mind is a terrible thing to waste 
 No love lost, I know I'm going crazy, I can't floss 
 Me, my lady left my homies it's all baloney 
 Just like rocking the old Pony's 
 So when I'm chilling, I'm just lost no more feeling 
 I need my honey in my life get that feel me 
 Take your time, readjust and ya you shine 
 My runaway love didn't mind, come on 
 Justin Bieber 
 I'm running out of time 
 Where is my runaway love? 
 Searching low and high 
 Know that I'm not giving up 
 I'd give it all up for her 
 But it'll never be enough 
 I won't stop until I find 
 My runaway love 
 I'm running out of time 
 Where is my runaway love? 
 Searching low and high 
 Know that I'm not giving up 
 I'd give it all up for her 
 But it'll never be enough 
 I won't stop until I find 
 My runaway love 
 Oh oh oh 
 Yeah 
 Oh baby
