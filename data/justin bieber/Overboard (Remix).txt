Miley Cyrus 
 Oh 
 Hello everybody, how you guys doing tonight? 
 It feels like we've been out at sea, oh 
 So back and forth that's how it seems, oh 
 And when I wanna talk you say to me 
 That if it's meant to be it will be 
 Whoa-oh-oh 
 So crazy is this thing we call love 
 And now that we've got it, we just can't give up 
 I'm reaching out for you 
 Get me out here in the water and I... 
 Miley Cyrus 
 I'm overboard 
 And I need your love to pull me up 
 I can't swim on my own 
 It's too much 
 Feels like I'm drowning without your love 
 So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver 
 Justin Bieber 
 Life saver, whoa, oh life saver 
 My life saver, whoa 
 Life saver, whoa, oh life saver 
 Never understood you when you'd say (whoa) 
 You wanted me to meet you halfway (whoa) 
 Oh, I felt like I was doing my part 
 You kept thinking you were coming up short 
 It's funny how things change 'cause now I see, oh 
 So crazy is this thing we call love 
 And now that we've got it we just can't give up 
 I'm reaching out for you 
 Got me out here in the water and I... 
 Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus 
 I'm overboard (overboard) 
 And I need your love to pull me up (to pull me up) 
 I can't swim on my own 
 It's too much (it's too much) 
 Feels like I'm drowning without your love 
 So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver 
 Oh, it's supposed to be some give and take, I know 
 But you're only taking and not giving anymore 
 So what do I do? (so what do I do) 
 Cause I still love you (I still love you baby) 
 And you're the only one who can save me, whoa whoa whoa 
 I'm overboard 
 And I need your love to pull me up (pull me up) 
 I can't swim on my own 
 It's too much (it's too much) 
 Feels like I'm drowning without your love 
 So throw yourself out to me 
 My lifesaver 
 Life saver, whoa, oh life saver 
 My life saver, whoa 
 Life saver, whoa, oh life saver 
 Life saver, whoa, oh life saver 
 My life saver, whoa 
 Life saver, whoa, oh life saver
