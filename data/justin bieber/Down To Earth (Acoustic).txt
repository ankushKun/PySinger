Oh oh 
 Oh ohhh 
 Oh oh 
 I never thought that it'd be easy 
 'Cause we're both so distant now 
 And the walls are closing in on us 
 And we're wondering how 
 No one has a solid answer 
 But just walking in the dark 
 And you can see the look on my face 
 It just tears me apart 
 So we fight 
 Through the hurt 
 And we cry and cry and cry and cry 
 Then we live 
 And we learn 
 And we try and try and try and try 
 So it's up to you 
 And it's up to me 
 That we meet in the middle 
 On our way back down to earth 
 Down to earth 
 Down to earth 
 On our way back down to earth 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Whoa oh 
 Oh 
 Mommy you were always somewhere 
 And daddy I live outta town 
 So tell me how could I ever be normal somehow? 
 You tell me this is for the best 
 So tell me why am I in tears? Oh whoa 
 So far away and now I just need you here 
 So we'll fight 
 Through the hurt 
 And we'll cry and cry and cry and cry 
 Then we live 
 And we learn 
 And we try and try and try and try 
 So it's up to you 
 And it's up to me 
 That we meet in the middle 
 On our way back down to earth 
 Down to earth 
 Down to earth 
 On our way back down to earth 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Whoa oh 
 Oh 
 We felt so far away from where we used to be 
 And now we're standing and where do we go 
 When there's no road 
 To get to your heart 
 Let's start over again 
 So it's up to you 
 And it's up to me 
 That we meet in the middle 
 On our way back down to earth 
 Down to earth 
 Down to earth 
 On our way back down to earth 
 I never thought that it'd be easy 
 'Cause we both so distant now 
 And the walls are closing in on us 
 And we're wondering how
