Baby I will not pout 
 Baby I will not cry 
 'Cause I've got your love this Christmas time 
 When the snow's on the ground 
 And it's freezing outside 
 I've got your love this Christmas 
 On every list I've ever sent 
 You're the gift I love the best 
 So deck the halls and all the rest 
 And warm me up with your Christmas love 
 Hey angel in the snow 
 I'm under the mistletoe 
 You are the one 
 You're my very own Christmas love 
 Tell Santa I'm cool this year 
 My present is standing right here 
 Thank God above for my very own Christmas love 
 Like a beautiful tree, you can light up the room 
 But your kind of star can't be removed 
 Yea, and like a beautiful carol 
 I get lost in your song 
 And I will forever sing along 
 On every list I've ever sent 
 You're the gift I love the best 
 So deck the halls and all the rest 
 And warm me up with your Christmas love 
 Hey angel in the snow 
 I'm under the mistletoe 
 You are the one 
 You're my very own Christmas love 
 Tell Santa I'm cool this year 
 My present is standing right here 
 Thank God above for my very own Christmas love 
 All the lovers around the world (all the lovers) 
 Got me singing Merry Merry Christmas 
 Merry merry Christmas (and Happy Holidays) 
 Every boy and every girl 
 Stay close to the ones you love and thank God above 
 That you got someone this year 
 That can feel your heart with cheer, yeah 
 Ooohhh 
 Hey angel in the snow 
 I'm under the mistletoe 
 You are the one 
 You're my very own Christmas love 
 Tell Santa I'm cool this year 
 My present is standing right here 
 Thank God above for my very own Christmas love 
 Hey angel in the snow 
 I'm under the mistletoe 
 You are the one 
 You're my very own Christmas love 
 Tell Santa I'm cool this year 
 My present is standing right here 
 Thank God above for my very own Christmas love 
 (For my very own Christmas love) 
 (For my very own Christmas love) 
 (Give me a kiss baby) 
 (Give me a kiss baby) 
 (For my very own Christmas love)
