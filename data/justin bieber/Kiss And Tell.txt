Yeah 
 J-J-J JB 
 Yeah, whoa 
 No, no 
 Now I can see it girl 
 You ain't gotta say nothing 
 Your lips are calling me 
 Like they wanna do something 
 I feel the chemistry 
 Yeah you're into me 
 A little kiss is a definite possibility 
 Seen you a couple times 
 Had a couple conversations 
 Since you've been on my mind 
 Had a couple observations 
 Like you're a fly chick 
 You could be my chick 
 Play by the rules and you can get what I give 
 Just keep it quiet, keep it on my hush 
 And what we do keep it just between us 
 I don't wanna see you tweet about JB 'cause 
 The only people that should know is you and me so 
 Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me 
 But I can't have you telling everybody 
 You got me all twisted with your lips like this 
 So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss) kiss and tell? 
 Tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss) kiss and tell? 
 Tell me are you gonna kiss me? 
 Then tell everybody? 
 Now she got me twisted with your lips girl 
 Are you gonna kiss and tell? 
 It's confidential, no one has to do with it 
 But you and me girl 
 Telling would ruin it 
 Don't need that TMZ 
 All in our privacy 
 Use them lips for kissing girl 
 If you wanna ride with me 
 And if you wanna tell somebody 
 Then we can call the whole thing off, no problem 
 You can go your way, and I'll go mine 
 But I'd rather spend a little time with you, yeah 
 Just keep it quiet, keep it on my hush 
 And what we do keep it just between us 
 I don't wanna see you tweet about JB 'cause 
 The only people that should know is you and me so 
 Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me 
 But I can't have you telling everybody 
 You got me all twisted with your lips like this 
 So tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss) kiss and tell? 
 Tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss) kiss and tell? 
 Tell me are you gonna kiss me? 
 Then tell everybody? oh no 
 Now she got me twisted with your lips girl 
 Are you gonna kiss and tell? 
 Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell? 
 Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell? 
 Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell? 
 Kiss and tell, oh 
 Don't tell your homies 
 Don't tell your mama 
 Don't tell your girlfriends 
 That'll start some drama 
 Stay off that facebook 
 I'll treat you real good 
 You keep this private 
 And you can get what I give 
 Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me 
 But I can't have you telling everybody (everybody) 
 You got me all twisted with your lips like this 
 So tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss) kiss and tell? 
 Tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss) kiss and tell? 
 Tell me are you gonna kiss me? 
 Then tell everybody? 
 Now she got me twisted with your lips girl 
 Are you gonna kiss and tell? 
 Kiss and tell, whoa 
 Whoa oh 
 I'm not about that 
 If you're gonna kiss and tell 
 No, no, no 
 If you're gonna kiss and tell 
 If you're gonna kiss and tell 
 That's not me
