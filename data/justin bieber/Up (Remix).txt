Justin Bieber 
 It's a big big world 
 It's easy to get lost in it 
 You've always been my girl, oh 
 And I'm not ready to call it quits 
 We can make the sun shine in the moonlight 
 We can make the grey clouds turn to blue skies 
 I know it's hard 
 Baby, believe me 
 That we can't go nowhere but up 
 From here, my dear 
 Baby, we can't go nowhere but up 
 Tell me what we've got to fear 
 We'll take it to the sky past the moon to the galaxy oh 
 As long as you're with me, baby 
 Honestly (honestly) with the strength of our love 
 We can't go nowhere but up 
 Chris Brown 
 It's a big big world 
 And girl I'm gonna show you all of it 
 I'm gonna lace you with pearls, oh 
 From every ocean that we're swimmin' in 
 We can make the sun shine in the moonlight 
 We can make the grey clouds turn to blue skies 
 Yeah, I know it's hard 
 Baby, believe me, ooh
