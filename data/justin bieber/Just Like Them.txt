I know it's hard but 
 Let's go 
 There's something different in your eyes baby 
 You can't seem to look into mine lately 
 Tell me what is on your mind baby 
 Or I'm gonna assume that something's wrong 
 I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed 
 'Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived 
 And I'm not barely trippin' I just can't do this again 
 Please don't tell me you're just like them 
 Please don't tell me you're just like them 
 You're just like them 
 I know that it's hard to trust of 
 But you need the trust that my love 
 Will never leave you in the dust 
 I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed 
 'Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived 
 And I'm not barely trippin' I just can't do this again 
 Please don't tell me you're just like them 
 Please don't tell me you're just like them 
 You're just like them 
 Baby you ain't get this love on track 
 Will you run away gotta wait on after love back 
 You know that I love you girl so tell me what you're waiting for 
 You gotta know know know know 
 Know know know know know know 
 Know know know know know know 
 I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed 
 'Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived 
 And I'm not barely trippin' I just can't do this again 
 Please don't tell me you're just like them 
 Please don't tell me you're just like them 
 You're just like them
