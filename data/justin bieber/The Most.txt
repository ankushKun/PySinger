Where are you now that I need ya? 
 Where are you now that I need ya? 
 Need you the most 
 When you broke down I didn’t leave ya 
 I stay by your side 
 So where are you now that I need ya? 
 Need you the most 
 I gave you attention when nobody else was paying 
 I gave you the shirt off my back what you saying 
 To keep you warm 
 I showed you the game everybody else was playing, that’s for sure 
 And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying, oh lord 
 Where are you now that I need ya? 
 Where are you now that I need ya? 
 Need you the most 
 When you broke down I didn’t leave ya 
 I stay by your side 
 So where are you now that I need ya? 
 Need you the most 
 I gave you my heart when you said yours was broken 
 Yes I did 
 I gave you the key when the door wasn’t open 
 Just admit it 
 See I gave you faith 
 Turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it 
 Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping 
 Tell me he, where are you now that I need you? 
 Where are you now? 
 Where are you now that I need ya? 
 Couldn’t find you anywhere 
 Where you broke down I didn’t leave ya 
 I was by your side 
 So where are you now that I need ya? 
 I need you the most
