Justin Bieber 
 Everybody's laughin' in my mind 
 Rumors spreadin' about this other guy 
 Do you do what you did when you did with me 
 Does he love you the way I can 
 Did you forget all the plans that you made with me 
 'Cause baby I didn't 
 Justin Bieber and Rascal Flatts 
 That should be me, holdin' your hand 
 That should be me, makin' you laugh (yeah) 
 That should be me, this is so sad 
 That should be me, that should be me 
 That should be me, feelin' your kiss (feeling your kiss) 
 That should be me, buyin' you gifts (buying you gifts) 
 This is so wrong, I can't go on (I can't go on) 
 Do you believe 
 That that should be me 
 That should be me (no) 
 You said you needed a little time from my mistakes 
 It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced 
 Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies 
 Whatcha doin' to me? 
 You're taking him where we used to go 
 Now if you're trying to break my heart 
 It's working, 'cause you know 
 That that should be me, holdin' your hand (holding your hand) 
 That should be me, makin' you laugh 
 That should be me, this is so sad (this is so sad) 
 That should be me, that should be me 
 That should be me, feelin' your kiss 
 That should be me, buyin' you gifts 
 This is so wrong, I can't go on 
 Do you believe 
 That should be me 
 I need to know should I fight for love 
 Or disarm 
 It's getting harder to shield 
 This pain is my heart 
 Ooh ooh 
 That should be me, holdin' your hand 
 That should be me, makin' you laugh 
 That should be me, this is so sad 
 That should be me, that should be me 
 That should be me, feelin' your kiss 
 That should be me, buyin' you gifts 
 This is so wrong, I can't go on 
 Do you believe 
 That that should be me 
 That should be me (no) 
 Holding your hand 
 That should be me 
 The one making you laugh (oh baby oh) 
 That should be me 
 That should be me 
 That should be me 
 Giving you flowers 
 Talking for hours 
 I never should've let you go 
 That should be me (that should be me) 
 Oh baby 
 That should be me 
 That should be me 
 That should be me
