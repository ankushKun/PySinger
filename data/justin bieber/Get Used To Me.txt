Subjected to my system, reflecting on the days 
 When we used to be just friends 
 Protected both our interests, our trust was in our bank 
 That's where our hearts once save 
 And then we got closer 
 Separated from my ex 'til we got closure 
 Ooh, on every visit, feelings got stronger 
 Now this is out our hands, my love is here to stay 
 So get used to me checking in all day 
 Get used to me falling through just to see your face 
 There in the moment I won't need your brace 
 Get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you 
 Oh get used to it, hey 
 Oh get used to it, hey 
 Oh get used to it, oh it 
 Oh used to me holding you, used to me warming you, oh get used to it 
 And now my April shower you, forever and for me 
 'Til your flowers bloom in June 
 Make sure that our fireworks be a fourth of July for life 
 As long as you stand right by my side 
 Keep growing closer throughout October 
 Ooh counting down, it's almost Christmas eve 
 Oh seven days shy of New Year's eve 
 Then we'll be celebrating 
 So get used to me checking in all day 
 Used to me falling through just to see your face 
 There in the moment I won't need your brace 
 Get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you 
 Oh get used to it, hey 
 Oh get used to it, hey 
 Oh get used to it, oh it 
 Oh used to be holding you, used to me warming you, oh get used to it
