 For you I'd write a symphony 
 I'd tell the violin 
 It's time to sink or swim 
 Watch them play for ya 
 For you I'd be (whoa oh) 
 Running a thousand miles 
 Just to get to where you are 
 Step to the beat of my heart 
 I don't need a whole lot 
 But for you I admit I 
 I'd rather give you the world 
 Or we can share mine 
 I know I won't be the first one 
 giving you all this attention 
 Baby listen 
 I just need somebody to love 
 I, I don't need too much, just somebody to love 
 Somebody to love 
 I don't need nothing else 
 I promise girl I swear

 Every day 
 I bring the sun around 
 I sweep away the clouds 
 Smile for me (smile for me) 
 I would take 
 Every second, every single time 
 Spend it like my last dime 
 Step to the beat of my heart 
 I don't need a whole lot 
 But for you I admit I 
 I'd rather give you the world 
 Or we can share mine 
 I know I won't be the first one 
 Givin' you all this attention
