She says she met me on a tour 
 She keeps knocking on my door, 
 She won't leave me, leave me alone 
 This girl she wouldn't stop, almost had to call the cops 
 She was scheming, ooh, she was wrong 
 'Cause she wanted all my attention 
 And she was dragging my name through the dirt 
 She was dying for my affection 
 But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her 
 I'm talking to you, Maria 
 Why you wanna do me like that? 
 That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl 
 Maria, why you wanna play me like that? 
 She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl 
 But she talking in, and she needs to quit it 
 But never this, all I know she's not mine 
 That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl 
 'Cause she's wildin out, what she talking about? 
 Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine 
 She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl 
 Now she's in the magazines, on TV, making a scene 
 Oh she's crazy, crazy in love 
 And she's all over the news, saying everything but the truth 
 She's faking, faking it all 
 'Cause she wanted all my attention 
 And she was dragging my name through the dirt 
 She was dying for my affection 
 But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her 
 I'm talking to you, maria 
 Why you wanna do me like that? 
 That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl 
 Maria, why you wanna play me like that? 
 She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl 
 But she talking in, and she needs to quit it 
 But never this, all I know she's not mine 
 That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl 
 'Cause she's wildin' out, what she talking about? 
 Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine 
 She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl 
 Why are you trying, trying to lie girl 
 When ain't I never met you at all 
 Saying goodbye, but how could ya 
 You throw this, you throw this 
 Your foolness, seduces 
 Maria why you wanna do me like that? 
 That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl 
 Maria, why you wanna play me like that? 
 She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl 
 But she talking in, and she needs to quit it 
 But never this, all I know she's not mine 
 That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl 
 'Cause she's wildin' out, what she talking about? 
 Let me tell you now that girl she's not mine 
 She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl 
 That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl 
 She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
