Don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it 
 Heart's in it, heart's in it 
 Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it 
 All in it, all in it 
 If you got a twenty for all of your tries 
 Twenty for all of the times, the times you got back up, whoa 
 You'd be a billionaire in a year 
 That's what you gotta think till you're there, on the record line 
 If you got a diamond for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication 
 You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah 
 Still don't condone it, love is a component 
 You're the only opponent, gotta seize the moment 
 And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it 
 Heart's in it, heart's in it 
 Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it 
 All in it, all in it 
 Gonna give me time 
 Said I won't hurt my side 
 Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it 
 All in it, all in it 
 All in it, all in it 
 Baby, I had a good time, and yes I pop strings 
 A guitar with only one string, I can only play one song, ooh 
 A simple melody, simple enough to make the world sing 
 Strong enough to make your mood swing, you know what I mean 
 If you got a diamond for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication 
 You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah 
 Still don't condone it, love is a component 
 You're the only opponent, gotta seize the moment 
 And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it 
 Heart's in it, heart's in it 
 Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it 
 All in it, all in it 
 Gonna give me time 
 Said I won't hurt my side 
 Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it 
 All in it, all in it 
 All in it, all in it 
 She growing up aight 
 I always felt like I had to be the best at everything 
 Because I, I just didn't think I wasn't good enough 
 And maybe if I was good at something, that I'd get recognition from that 
 But I quickly found out that 
 I wasn't going to get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed 
 Because, because people aren't perfect 
 And, by not being perfect you, you sometimes can disappoint people 
 And with God, it's like he's perfect and he never disappoints 
 So I just get my recognition from him 
 And give him recognition
