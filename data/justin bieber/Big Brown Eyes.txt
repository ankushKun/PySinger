Hey lonely lady with the big brown eyes I'm thinking your sadder than you realize 
 I could make you smile and feel a little more realated 
 We just really click, Would it be so wrong if we dated? 
 Let's gooo... jump on my skateboard, eat some cake along the lake. 
 I'll do all... your favorite stuff right off the cuff 'cause we're spontaneous 
 Lets hop on the bus to shop we'llcheck out filene's and get chunky jelwery at chico's 
 I'll buy you a panini and some spanks to make you tinny 
 Lonely lady with the big brown eyyyeees.
