Oh 
 Yeah 
 Mmmm 
 I'd wait on you forever and a day 
 Hand and foot 
 Your world is my world 
 Yeah 
 Ain't no way you're ever gon' get 
 Any less than you should 
 'Cause baby 
 You smile, I smile ohhh 
 You smile, I smile oh 
 Your lips, my biggest weakness 
 Shouldn't have let you know 
 I'm always gonna do what they say yeah 
 If you need me 
 I'll come runnin' 
 From a thousand miles away 
 When you smile, I smile oh 
 And whenever you smile, I smile oh 
 Baby take my open heart and all it offers 
 'Cause this is as unconditional as it'll ever get 
 You ain't seen nothing yet 
 I won't ever hesitate to give you more 
 'Cause baby 
 You smile, I smile whoa 
 You smile, I smile oh 
 And whenever you smile, I smile 
 I smile, I smile, I smile 
 You smile, I smile oh 
 Baby you won't ever want for nothing 
 You are my ends and my means now 
 With you there's no in between 
 I'm all in 
 Cause my cards are on the table 
 And I'm willing and I'm able 
 But I fold to your wish 
 Cause it's my command 
 Whenever you smile, I smile whoa 
 You smile, I smile 
 I smile, I smile, I smile 
 You smile, I smile 
 And whenever you smile, I smile 
 When you smile, I smile 
 You smile, I smile
