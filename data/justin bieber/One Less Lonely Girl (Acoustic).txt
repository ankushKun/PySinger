One less lonely girl 
 One less lonely girl 
 One less lonely girl 
 How many "I told you's" and "start over's" and shoulders have you cried on before? 
 How many promises? Be honest, girl 
 How many tears you let hit the floor? 
 How many bags you packed 
 Just to take them back? 
 Tell me that how many "either or's"? 
 But no more if you let me inside of your world 
 There'll be one less lonely girl 
 Oh no, saw so many pretty faces 
 Now all I see is you 
 Oh no, don't need these other pretty faces 
 'Cause when you're mine, in the world 
 There's gonna be one less lonely girl 
 One less lonely girl 
 One less lonely girl 
 One less lonely girl 
 There's gonna be one less lonely girl 
 I'm gonna put you first 
 I'll show you what you're worth 
 If you let me inside of your world 
 There's gonna be one less lonely girl 
 Christmas wasn't merry, 14th of February not one of them spent with you 
 How many dinner dates, set dinner plates 
 And he didn't even touch his food 
 How many torn photographs are you taping back? 
 Tell me that you couldn't see an open door 
 But no more, if you let me inside of your world 
 There'll be one less lonely girl 
 Oh no, saw so many pretty faces 
 Now all I see is you 
 Oh no, don't need these other pretty faces 
 'Cause when you're mine, in this world 
 There's gonna be one less lonely girl 
 One less lonely girl 
 One less lonely girl 
 One less lonely girl 
 I'm gonna put you first 
 I'll show you what you're worth 
 If you let me inside of your world 
 There's gonna be one less lonely girl 
 I can fix up your broken heart 
 I can give you a brand new start 
 I can make you believe 
 I just wanna set one girl free to fall 
 She's free to fall 
 With me 
 Her heart's locked and know what I got the key 
 I'll take you and leave the world with one less lonely girl 
 One less lonely girl 
 One less lonely girl 
 One less lonely girl 
 One less lonely girl 
 There's gonna be one less lonely girl 
 One less lonely girl 
 One less lonely girl 
 I'm gonna put you first 
 I'll show you what you're worth 
 If you let me inside of your world 
 One less lonely girl 
 One less lonely girl 
 One less lonely girl 
 I'm gonna put you first 
 I'll show you what you're worth 
 If you let me inside of your world 
 There's gonna be one less lonely girl
