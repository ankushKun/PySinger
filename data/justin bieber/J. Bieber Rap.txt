ATL, baby, is where I resign, 
 I'm a young white rapper, and I don't get high. 
 Teenage girls, is what I really like, 
 And I'm still a young boy, but I'm still so fly. 
 Yeah, you see my smile, caught it on the camera. 
 Drink a Red Bull, grew wings, see the stamina. 
 Shoutout to my boys, yeah they up there in Canada; 
 I used to live there, till I moved to Atlanta; 
 Where the girls are so hot, yeah the girls are fine too, 
 Catchin' Bieber Fever, forget the Swine Flu. 
 Can I be the one to take you 'round town? 
 Be the one ya call when ya feeling so down. 
 I can be ya man, you can be my crown. 
 Yeah, I'm J.Bieber; first name, last name. 
 J.Bieber, checkin' on the past lane. 
 I'm J.Bieber, I'm always in the fast lane.
