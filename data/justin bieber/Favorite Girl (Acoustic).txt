 So many times I wished 
 You'd be the one for me 
 But never knew you'd get like this 
 Girl what you do to me 
 You're who I'm thinking of 
 And girl you ain't my runner up 
 And no matter what, you're always number one 
 My prize possession 
 One and only 
 Adore ya girl I want ya 
 The one I can't live without 
 That's you

 The one that makes me crazy 
 Of all the girls I've ever known

 You're always going out your way 
 To impress these Mr. Wrongs 
 But you can be yourself with me 
 I'll take you as you are 
 I know they said believe in love 
 Is a dream that can't be real 
 So girl let's write a fairytale 
 And show 'em how we feel 
 You're who I'm thinking of 
 And girl you ain't my runner up 
 And no matter what, you're always number one 
 My prize possession

 Adore ya girl I want ya
