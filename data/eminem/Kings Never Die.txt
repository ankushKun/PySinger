Here to stay 
 Even when I'm gone 
 When I close my eyes 
 Through the passage of time 
 Kings never die 
 I can hear the drummer drumming 
 And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know something's coming 
 But I'm running from it to be standing at the summit 
 And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was 
 Was it, too good to be true? 
 Have nothing, get it all but too much of it 
 Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens 
 'Cause if not, where the hell did it go? 
 'Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven 
 Just choosing to sin 
 Even if it means I'm selling my soul, just to be the undisputed again 
 Do whatever I gotta do just to win 
 'Cause I got this motherfucking cloud over my head 
 Crown around it, thorns on it 
 Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't 
 Think I'd be back, did ya? 
 How 'bout that I'm somehow now back to the underdog 
 But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is something I never bow-wow'd at 
 I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate 
 But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt 
 Even when you bitches are counting me out, and I appear to be down for the count 
 Only time I ever been out and about is driving around town with my fucking whereabouts in a doubt 
 'Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter 
 Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up 
 Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept going 
 I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong 
 'Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone? 
 'Cause someone told me that 
 (Kings never die) 
 Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir 
 You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep 
 Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer 
 Wouldn't even take shit into consideration 
 Obliterate anyone in the way 
 I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me 
 But it'd actually have to be a fucking blowout to get me to retire 
 Tell these new artists that kings never die 
 I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page 
 Did it just say I've been upstaged? 
 Why am I online? It's driving me crazy 
 I'm riding shotgun tryna get a gauge 
 On what's hot, but I'm not gonna' conform 
 But as days pass in this shit 
 And opinions sway, I can hear them say 
 If I stay passionate maybe I can stay Jay miraculous 
 Comeback as if I went away 
 But detractors just say so much for the Renegade 
 Someone's gonna make me blow my composure 
 Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage 
 Some want a champion to fall 
 I still wonder why I laugh at 'em, 'cause why care when I'm awesome? 
 Fuck what these cynics say 
 Just goes to show that when my back's against the wall 
 And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm posted up 
 With this pent up rage, 'cause all these plaques in my office 
 On the floor stacked against the door 
 Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again? 
 'Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards 
 And trophies just don't mean jack anymore 
 If I'm here today and gone tomorrow 
 And I'm not gonna be 
 Here to stay 
 Even when I'm gone 
 When I close my eyes 
 Through the passage of time 
 Kings never die 
 I want it, I'm coming to get it 
 So you son of a bitches don't duck you're gonna get Riddick Bowe'd 
 Critics'll end up in critical, think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked then 
 And I'm not stopping till I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne 
 Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed 
 Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard I broke my collarbone 
 And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving 
 Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that 
 Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, 'cause 
 They say kings never die 
 Just ask Jam Master Jay 
 They just grow wings and they fly 
 So, hands up, reach for the sky 
 Try to hold up and prolong these moments 
 'Cause in a blink of an eye 
 They'll be over 
 Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur 
 And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were 
 So before you're leaving this Earth 
 You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk 
 Deacon of words, syllable genius at work 
 Plus I'm thinking that they're mistaking my kindness for weakness, kill 'em with meanness 
 I went from powdered milk and Farina 
 To flipping burgers on the grill for some peanuts 
 From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers 
 I made it to the silverscreen where Rocky's still what the theme is 
 Khalil on the beat 'cause making the beat ain't the same feeling to me as killing the beat is 
 So fulfilling to me is what filling a seat is 
 That sound, vomit, thirst and how common underground commons eat 
 Outsider stomach growl, throbbing hunger 
 Out-rhyming everyone, God just give me one shot 
 I swear that I won't let you down 
 I'mma be around forever, entertain even in the ground 
 You ain't never ever gonna hear me say I ain't 
 Here to stay 
 Even when I'm gone 
 When I close my eyes 
 Through the passage of time 
 Kings never die
