Some days I just wanna up and call it quits 
 I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks 
 Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits 
 My life's like one great big ball of shit 
 If I could just put it all into all I spit 
 Instead of always trying to swallow it 
 Instead of staring at this wall and shit 
 While I sit, writer's block, sick of all this shit 
 Can't call it shit 
 All I know is I'm about to hit the wall 
 If I have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits 
 This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it 
 I ain't dealing with another fucking politic 
 I'm like a skillet bubbling until it filters up 
 I'm about to kill it, I can feel it building up 
 Blow this building up, I've concealed enough 
 My cup runneth over, I done filled it up 
 The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts 
 You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts 
 Well I'm a show you what, you gonna feel my rush 
 You don't feel it? Then it must be too real to touch 
 Peel the dutch, I'm about to tear shit up 
 Goosebumps, yeah I'm a make your hair sit up 
 Yeah sit up, I'm a tell you who I be 
 I'm a make you hate me 'cause you ain't me 
 You wait, it ain't too late to finally see 
 What you close-minded fucks were to blind to see 
 Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee 
 Out this world, ain't no one out their mind as me 
 You need peace of mind, here's a piece of mine 
 All I need's a line but sometimes 
 I don't always find the words to rhyme 
 To express how I'm really feeling at that time 
 Yeah sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, just sometimes 
 It's always me, how dark can these hallways be? 
 The clock strikes midnight, 1, 2, then half past 3 
 This half-ass rhyme with this half-ass piece of paper 
 I'm desperate at my desk, if I could just get the rest 
 Of this shit off my chest again, stuck in this slump 
 Can't think of nothing, fuck I'm stumped 
 Uh, wait, here comes something 
 Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out, new pad 
 Crinkle it up and throw the shit out 
 I'm fizzling now, thought I figured it out 
 Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out 
 I'm afraid, but why am I afraid? 
 Why am I a slave to this trade? 
 Cyanide I spit to the grave, real enough to rile you up 
 Want me to flip it? I can rip it any style you want 
 I'm a switch-hitter bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter 
 I'm a sit here 'til I get enough in me 
 To finally hit a fucking boiling point 
 Put some oil in your joints 
 Flip the coin bitch, come get destroyed 
 An MC's worst dream, I make them tense 
 They hate me, see me and shake like a chain-link fence 
 By the looks of them you would swear that Jaws was coming 
 By the scream of them you would swear I'm sawing someone 
 By the way they running you would swear the law was coming 
 It's now or never and tonight it's all or nothing 
 Momma, Jimmy keeps leaving on us, he said he'd be back 
 He pinky promised, I don't think he's honest 
 I be back baby I just got to beat this clock 
 Fuck this clock, I'm a make them eat this watch 
 Don't believe me watch, I'm a win this race 
 And I'm a come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch 
 I found my niche, you gonna hear my voice 
 'Til you're sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice 
 If I gotta scream 'til I have half a lung 
 If I have half a chance I'll grab it, rabbit run
