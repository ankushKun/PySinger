(Ca$his) 
 Remix! 
 (Eminem) 
 As the crabby little bastard that I am 
 Sly what the fuck a slick sick son of a bitch 
 Silly little rabbit don't you know 'Trix' are for kids 
 This is what the moral to the story is 
 (Ca$his) Re-Up! 
 (Verse 1 - Eminem) 
 Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care 
 My enemies crack corn, but I don't care 
 You can be black, white or a albino yeah 
 You can have corn rows inside your hair 
 I give a fuck if I don't like your stare 
 This bottle of wine goes upside your head 
 A little bit psycho, but I know that 
 Think you just don't say it, then I won't say it 
 See if you don't brag, then I don't brag 
 I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad 
 I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit 
 You can just keep making them tired old threats 
 A little bit like the boy who cried wolf yeah 
 See me, but don't dare to try no shit 
 Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers 
 A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass 
 And I can be so quiet and strike so fast 
 Like lightning bolts right out the sky go *blah* 
 From outta nowhere, you might find your career 
 Come to an *ERR!* and I'm just like (Oh Yeah!) 
 (Chorus - Eminem) 
 See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah) 
 Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah) 
 See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah) 
 See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care 
 See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah) 
 See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em) 
 And where is D12 at, they like (We over here) 
 And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where) 
 (Verse 2 - Eminem) 
 You jealous little fucks beg for my attention but 
 I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want 
 If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice 
 If you keep coming back, that only means you know you lost the fight 
 They wanna talk shit, let 'em talk shit, 'cause they talk shit 
 Knowing deep down, they really just wanna squash it 
 Cause no one wants to walk around, stepping in dog shit 
 And get doo-doo on their shoe again, soon as they washed it 
 But the pride won't let em, inside's like 'go get em' 
 And I'm just like 'Why your tryna fight momentum' 
 We just keep winning, by landslides oh and umm 
 Shady Limited's in any size yo, Denim 
 To velour, even our clothing line's on fire 
 As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiya' 
 Meanwhile your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah 
 And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars 
 But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her 
 Right in the ass with KY, yes sir! 
 So full of joy, boy am I absurd 
 Even Chingy would tell you 
 'Tharr boi don't curr' 
 (Chorus - Eminem) 
 See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah) 
 Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah) 
 See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah) 
 See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care 
 See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah) 
 See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em) 
 And where is G-Unit at, they like (We over here) 
 And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where) 
 (Verse 3 - Ca$his) 
 Ca$his! 
 Watch Jimmy get cracked to the floor wit a round 
 Spun around and hit the ground 
 You the new James Brown 
 New king of Mo-Town 
 Side wit folk while 
 You not a G you a joke and thay all know now 
 I don't brag about the way that I lived in the past 
 I just pray I get away after whoppin' your ass 
 From now on don't speak namin' your reps 
 I'll hop out yo' pussys' restin' on blech 
 But I told you Ca$his consecutively sweet life off the beat all you hear is me 
 I'm A B.B.G plus a B.G.D Bring it on anytime you wanna come see me 
 Stay alive lil' guy you don't want it with me 
 And your man Fifty put your money on me 
 King Mathers made me to blow up 
 Re-Up I'll crush that you know Cash up Shady! 
 (Chorus - Eminem) 
 See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah) 
 Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah) 
 See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah) 
 See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care 
 See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah) 
 See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em) 
 And where is D12 at, they like (We over here) 
 And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where, no where, no where)
