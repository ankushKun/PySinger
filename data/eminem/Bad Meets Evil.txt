Jeff Bass 
 I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts 
 You know, there's a story behind that there saloon 
 Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over 
 Sheriffs couldn't stop them 
 Quickest damn gunslingers I've ever seen 
 Got murdered in cold blood 
 That old saloon there was their little home away from home 
 They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern 
 And on a quiet night 
 You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce da 5'9" 
 Eminem 
 I don't speak 
 I float in the air, wrapped in a sheet 
 I'm not a real person 
 I'm a ghost trapped in a beat 
 I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph 
 And the noise is spread 
 Picked up and transmitted through Royce's head 
 Trap him in his room 
 Possess him and hoist his bed 
 'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead 
 Told him each one of his boys is dead 
 I asked him to come to the dark side 
 He made a choice and said 
 Royce da 5'9" 
 Yo, who hard? Yo, I done heard worse 
 We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other 
 To see which one'll swerve first 
 Two blind bandits panic 
 Whose mental capacity holds 
 That of a globe on top of nine other planets 
 Kiss the cheek of the Devil 
 Intelligence level is helly 
 Getting treble peaking on speakers in the ghetto 
 Dismissal, I'm not a fair man 
 Disgrace the race of a atheist 
 Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a Patriot 
 One track sliced without swords 
 I buried the Christ corpse 
 In my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse 
 And stay overworked 
 It's like the Nazis and the Nation collaborating 
 Attempting to take over the Earth 
 Eminem 
 'Cause this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil 
 We hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people 
 He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal 
 Above the law 'cause I don't agree with police either 
 Royce da 5'9": 
 Shit, me neither 
 We ain't eager to be legal 
 So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle 
 I breathe ether in three lethal amounts 
 While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle 
 Releasing rage on anybody in squeezing range 
 Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain 
 Royce da 5'9": 
 He's insane 
 No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off 
 'Cause I can't find a decent vein 
 Royce da 5'9" 
 The disaster with dreads 
 I'm Bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough 
 To kill my soul after I'm dead 
 When in danger it's funny 
 Actually my flavor's similar to a waiter 
 'Cause I serve any stranger with money 
 I spray a hundred 
 Man until they joint chains 
 While slipping bullets at point blank range like they was punches 
 Piss on the flag and burn it 
 Murder you, then come to your funeral 
 Service lobby, and strangle your body to confirm it 
 Whipping human ass, throwing blows, cracking jaws 
 With my fists wrapped in gauze 
 Dipped in glue and glass 
 I'm blazing MCs, at the same time amazing MCs 
 Somehow MCs ain't that eyebrow-raising to me 
 From all of angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough to cast a avalanche 
 And bust 'til volcanoes erupt 
 Eminem 
 Hello? 
 (Billy?) 
 Hey yo what's up? 
 (We're coming to get you) 
 Stop, they know it's us 
 I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? 
 (Uh-uh) 
 I'm the one who burned your house down 
 (Oh) 
 Well I'm out now 
 (Shit) 
 And this time I'm coming back to blow your house up 
 And I ain't gone leave you with a window to jump out of 
 Give me two fat tabs and three 'shrooms 
 And you won't see me 
 Like fat people in steam rooms 
 And when I go to hell and I'm getting ready to leave 
 I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe 
 Royce da 5'9" 
 'Cause this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil 
 And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people 
 He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal 
 Against peaceful 
 See you in Hell for the sequel 
 Eminem: 
 We'll be waiting 
 See you in Hell 
 Wall Street 
 Eminem: 
 Dope 
 Royce da 5'9" 
 Slim Shady 
 See you in Hell for the sequel 
 Eminem: 
 Bye-bye 
 Bad Meets Evil 
 What? 
 Eminem: 
 Until next time 
 Jeff Bass 
 And so that's the story of when Bad Meets Evil 
 Two of the most wanted individuals in the county 
 Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens 
 It's too bad they had to go out the way they did 
 Got shot in the back coming out of that old saloon 
 But their spirits still live on to this day 
 Shush 
 Wait, d'y'all hear that?
