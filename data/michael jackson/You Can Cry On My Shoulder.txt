Just because you know I love you so much 
 Don't be afraid to tell me you're sad 
 Because you lost his love 
 Though your love is not for me 
 I don't wanna see you in mysery, so come on, baby come on 
 You can cry on my shoulder... 
 You can cry on my shoulder 
 And bring all your troubles to me 
 All your troubles to me 
 Big girls ain't supposed to cry, 
 If you do I'll understand, 
 Maybe I can show you how you can win his love again 
 It may seem strange I know 
 But it's just that I love you 
 So come on, baby come on 
 You can cry on my shoulder 
 You can cry on my shoulder 
 And bring all your troubles to me. 
 All your troubles to me 
 Girl you've given him all you had 
 He, d better stop treating you so bad, 
 Come on babe, come on, oh yeah 
 You can cry on my shoulder, yes you can girl 
 You can cry on my shoulder 
 And bring all your troubles to me, yeah babe, yes you can now
