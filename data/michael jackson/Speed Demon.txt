Choop! Choop! 
 Choop! Choop! 
 Choop! 
 I'm headed for the border 
 It's on my mind 
 And nothin' really matters 
 I've got to be on time 
 Look in the view mirror 
 Is he hot on my tracks 
 Is he getting nearer 
 I feel some heat is on 
 My back 
 Choop! Choop! 
 (Speed demon) 
 Speedin' on the freeway 
 Gotta get a leadway 
 (Speed demon) 
 Doin' it on the highway 
 Gotta have it my way 
 (Speed demon) 
 Mind is like a compass 
 I'm stoppin' at nothin' 
 (Speed demon) 
 (He say) Pull over boy and 
 Get your ticket right 
 Choop! 
 And nothin' gonna stop me 
 Ain't no stoppin', go! 
 I'm speedin' on the midway 
 I gotta really burn this road 
 (Speed demon) 
 Speedin' on the freeway 
 Gotta get the leadway 
 (Speed demon) 
 Doin' it on the highway 
 Gotta have it my way 
 (Speed demon) 
 Mind is like a compass 
 I'm stoppin' at nothin' 
 (Speed demon) 
 (He say) Pull over boy and 
 Get your ticket right 
 Speed demon, you're the 
 Very same one 
 Who said the future's in 
 Your hands 
 The life you save could be 
 Your own 
 You're preachin' 'bout my 
 Life like you're the law 
 Gonna live each day and 
 Hour like 
 For me there's no tomorrow 
 Go! Go! Go! Aaow! 
 (Speed demon) 
 Speedin' on the freeway 
 Gotta get a leadway 
 (Speed demon) 
 Got fire in my pocket 
 I just lit a rocket 
 (Speed demon) 
 Just pull over boy 
 And get your ticket right 
 (Speed demon) 
 Pull over boy and 
 Get your ticket right 
 (Speed demon) 
 Just, pull over boy 
 And eat your ticket 
 Pull over boy 
 Pull over boy 
 And get your ticket right 
 Ugh! 
 Aaow! 
 Uh! 
 Hoo! 
 Get your ticket right 
 Pull over boy 
 Get your ticket right 
 Pull over boy and 
 Get your ticket right 
 Pull over boy 
 Pull over boy and 
 Get your ticket 
 Eat your ticket 
 Get your ticket 
 Eat yo', get yo', hoo! Aaow! 
 Get your ticket right
