There is a time when we should hear the certain calls 
 'Cause the world it seems it's right in this climb 
 'Cause there's a chance for taking in needing our own lives 
 It seems we need nothing at all 
 I used to feel that I should give away my heart 
 And it shows that fear of needing it there 
 Then I read the headlines and it said they're dying there 
 And it shows that we must heed instead 
 We are the world 
 We are the children 
 We are the ones who make a brighter day 
 So let's start giving 
 There's a chance we're taking 
 We're taking our own lives 
 It's true we'll make a brighter day 
 Just you and me 
 Give in your heart and you will see that someone cares 
 'Cause you know that they can feed them all 
 Then I read the paper and it said that you've been denied 
 And it shows the second we will call 
 We are the world 
 We are the children 
 We are the ones who make a brighter day 
 So let's start giving 
 There's a chance we're taking 
 We're taking our own lives 
 It's true we'll make a brighter day 
 Just you and me 
 Now there's a time when we must love them all 
 And it seems that life, it don't make love at all 
 But if you'd been there, and I'll love you more and more 
 It seems in life, I didn't do that 
 We are the world, the world 
 We are the children, are the children 
 We are the ones who make a brighter day 
 So let's start giving, let's start giving 
 There's a chance we're taking 
 We're taking our own lives 
 It's true we'll make a brighter day 
 Just you and me 
 We are the world, are the world 
 We are the children, are the children 
 We are the ones who make a brighter day 
 So let's start giving, let's start giving 
 But there's a chance we're taking, taking 
 We're taking our own lives 
 It's true we'll make a brighter day 
 Just you and me 
 We are the world, shalom 
 We are the children, shalingin 
 We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom 
 So let's start giving, 'cause that's what we're being 
 There's a chance we're taking 
 We're taking our own lives 
 It's true we'll make a brighter day 
 Just you and me 
 Come on, yeah 
 We are the world, shalom 
 We are the children, shalingin 
 We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom 
 So let's start giving, 'cause that's what we're being 
 There's a chance we're taking 
 We're taking our own lives 
 It's true we'll make a brighter day 
 Just you and me 
 Oh yeah, we got it 
 We are the world, shalom 
 We are the children, shalingin 
 We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom 
 So let's start giving, 'cause that's what we're being 
 There's a chance we're taking 
 We're taking our own lives 
 It's true we'll make a brighter day 
 Just you and me
