When the world is on your shoulder 
 Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down 
 If you can't hang with the feeling 
 Then there ain't no room for you in this part of town 
 'Cause we're the party people night and day 
 Living crazy, that's the only way 
 So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five up on the shelf 
 And just enjoy yourself 
 Groove, let the madness in the music get to you 
 Life ain't so bad at all if you live it off the wall 
 Life ain't so bad at all 
 Live life off the wall 
 Live your life off the wall 
 Live it off the wall 
 You can shout out all you want to 
 'Cause there ain't no sin in folks all getting loud 
 If you take the chance and do it 
 Then there ain't no one who's gonna put you down 
 'Cause we're the party people night and day 
 Living crazy, that's the only way 
 So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five up on the shelf 
 And just enjoy yourself (come on and groove) 
 Groove, let the madness in the music get to you 
 Life ain't so bad at all if you live it off the wall 
 Life ain't so bad at all 
 Live life off the wall 
 Live your life off the wall 
 Live it off the wall 
 Do what you want to do 
 There ain't no rules, it's up to you (ain't no rules, it's all up to you) 
 It's time to come alive 
 And party all right through the night (all right) 
 Gotta hide your inhibitions 
 Gotta let that fool loose deep inside your soul 
 Wanna see an exhibition 
 Better do it now before you get too old 
 'Cause we're the party people night and day 
 Living crazy, that's the only way 
 So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five up on the shelf 
 And just enjoy yourself (come on and groove, yeah) 
 Groove, let the madness in the music get to you 
 Life ain't so bad at all if you live it off the wall 
 Life ain't so bad at all (live it off the wall) 
 Live your life off the wall 
 So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five up on the shelf 
 And just enjoy yourself (come on and groove, yeah) 
 Groove, let the madness in the music get to you 
 Life ain't so bad at all if you live it off the wall 
 Tonight, gotta leave that nine to five up on the shelf (yeah) 
 And just enjoy yourself (come on and groove, yeah) 
 Groove, let the madness in the music get to you 
 Life ain't so bad at all (wanna live) 
 Tonight (yeah, yeah), gotta leave that nine to five up on the shelf (nine to five) 
 And just enjoy yourself (come on and groove, yeah) 
 Groove, let the madness in the music get to you 
 Life ain't so bad at all (yeah)
