I watch the snowflake fall 
 Against my window pain 
 And wonder if you 
 Are watching snowflakes too 
 I take a walk downtown 
 To where you used to meet me 
 There's joy everywhere 
 But all that waiting there is 
 Just a little Christmas tree Lookin' sorta sad and lonely just like me No one seems to care They just went away and left it standing there 
 All alone on Christmas eve 
 I hear the Christmas bells 
 (Bum Bum Bum) 
 The happy people singing 
 The songs of good cheer that only brings me tears 
 I sadly close my eyes 
 And say a little prayer 
 You'll be waiting there for me 
 I look but all I see is 
 Just a little Christmas tree Lookin' sorta sad and lonely just like me No one seems to care They just went away and left it standing there All alone on Christmas eve 
 This is the season of love 
 (This is the season of love) 
 But I'm as sad as I can be 
 (Sad as can be) 
 Why did you have to leave me 
 (Why did you leave me) 
 (Why did you leave me) 
 Just a little Christmas tree Lookin' sorta sad and lonely just like me No one seems to care They just went away and left it standing there All alone on Christmas eve
