You take sugar and spice 
 Everything nice 
 And you got a little girl 
 You take snakes and snails 
 Some puppy dog tails 
 And you got a little boy 
 That's what love is made of 
 That's what love is made of 
 Snakes snails puppy dog tails 
 Sugar and spice and everything nice 
 Yeah yeah all right 
 Something else to do 
 You take a walk by the sea 
 Two hearts on a tree 
 And you got a little gladness 
 Blue eyes cry 
 Two hearts say goodbye 
 And you got a little sadness 
 That's what love is made of 
 That's what love is made of 
 Hearts say goodbye 
 Eyes start to cry 
 Heart on a tree 
 Walk by the sea 
 Snakes snails puppy dog tails 
 Sugar and spice everything nice 
 Yeah yeah all right 
 One more thing 
 You take a cruel word spoken 
 Pride gets broken 
 And you got a little break-up 
 You take a little bit of soul 
 Sweet words being told 
 And you got a little make-up 
 That's what love is made of 
 That's what love is made of 
 Words being told 
 With a little bit of soul 
 Pride gets broken 
 Cruel words spoken 
 Hearts say goodbye 
 Eyes start to cry 
 Walk by the sea 
 Snkaes snails puppy dog tails 
 Sugar and spice everything nice 
 Yeah yeah all right
