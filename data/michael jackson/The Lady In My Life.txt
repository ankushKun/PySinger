There'll be no darkness tonight 
 Lady, our love will shine 
 (Lighting the light) 
 Just put your trust in my heart 
 And meet me in paradise 
 (Now is the time) 
 Girl, you're every wonder in this world to me 
 A treasure time won't steal away 
 So listen to my heart 
 Lay your body close to mine 
 Let me fill you with my dreams 
 I can make you feel all right 
 And, baby, through the years 
 Gonna love you more each day 
 So I promise you tonight 
 That you'll always be the lady in my life 
 Lay back in my tenderness 
 Let's make this a night we won't forget 
 Girl, I need your sweet caress 
 Reach out to a fantasy 
 Two hearts in the beat of ecstasy 
 Come to me, girl 
 And I will keep you warm 
 Through the shadows of the night 
 Let me touch you with my love 
 I can make you feel so right 
 And, baby, through the years 
 Even when we're old and gray 
 I will love you more each day 
 'Cause you will always be the lady in my life 
 Stay with me 
 I want you to stay with me 
 I need you by my side 
 Don't you go nowhere 
 (Ooh, girl, let me keep you warm) 
 Let me keep you warm 
 (You are the lady in my life)
