Yeah, Yeah... 
 Now I'm just wondering why you think 
 That you can get to me with anything 
 Seems like you'd know by now, when and how I get down 
 And with all that I've been through I'm still around 
 Don't you ever make no mistake 
 Baby I've got what it takes 
 And there's no way you'll ever get to me 
 (Come on) Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me 
 'Cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you baby (See I'm) (Ha!) 
 You can't believe it you can't concieve it 
 And you can't touch me 'cause I'm untouchable 
 And I know you hate it and you can't take it 
 You'll never break me 'cause I'm unbreakable 
 You know that, I'm, ah, well 
 Now you can't stop me even though you think 
 That if you block me you've done your thing 
 And when you bury me underneath all your pain 
 I'm steady laughin' while surfacing 
 Don't you ever make no mistake 
 Baby I've got what it takes (Can't) 
 And there's no way you'll ever get to me 
 Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me 
 (Come on) 'Cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you baby (I'm too much for you baby) 
 You can't believe it, you can't concieve it 
 And you can't touch me 'cause I'm untouchable 
 And I know you hate it and you can't take it 
 You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable (You can't break me) 
 You can't believe it, you can't concieve it 
 And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable (You can't touch me) 
 And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (Come on now) (Yeah-eah-eah) 
 You'll never break me, 
 You can't stand with me, 'cause I'm unbreakable 
 You can try to stop me, but it won't do a thing 
 No matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here 
 Through all your lies and silly games 
 I'ma still remain the same, 
 I'm unbreakable (Uh, uh, what, uh) 
 Lime to a lemon, my D.C. women 
 Bringin' in ten G minimums to condos with elevators in 'em 
 Vehicles with televisions in 'em 
 Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages 
 Disappearing acts, strictly nines and macs 
 Killers be serial, Copperfield material 
 My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it 
 Any place I visit, I got land there 
 How can players stand there and say I sound like them 
 Hello?! 
 Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow 
 Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow 
 Spray up your Day's Inn, any 'telle you in 
 Crack braggin sick of braggin how my mink be draggin 
 Desert ease street sweeper inside the beamer wagon 
 I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die 
 Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messin with the devil 
 WHAT! 
 You can't believe it, you can't concieve it (Yeah) 
 And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable (I'm untouchable) ('Cause I'm Untouchable) 
 And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (Yeah) 
 You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable (Ah-ah-ah-ah) (I'm unbreakable) 
 You can't believe it you can't concieve it (You-you-you-you-you) 
 And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable (Yeah, yeah) 
 And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (You hate it) (Ooh) 
 You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable ('Cause I'm unbreakable) 
 You can't believe it, you can't concieve it (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (Hoo, hoo!) 
 And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable (Yeah) (Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah) 
 And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (Why you do it) (Just why you do it) 
 (Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo) You'll never break me, 
 You can't touch me 
 You can't break me 
 You can't stand with me 
 'Cause I'm unbreakable 
 OWW! 
 GO ON!
