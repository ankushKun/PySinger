 Xscape (Ow) 
 Xscape (Ow) 
 Xscape 
 Everywhere I turn, no matter where I look, 
 The systems in control, it's all ran by the book, 
 I've got to get away so I can clear my mind, 
 Xscape is what I need, away from electric eyes 
 No matter where I am, I seen my face around, 
 They pin lies on my name, and push them from town to town, 
 Don't have a place to run, but there's no need to hide, 
 I've got to, find a place, 
 So I won't hide away 
 Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today 
 Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships that go away 
 Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man 
 Xscape, I do what I wanna 'cause I gotta face nobody but me 
 Sometimes I feel like 
 I've gotta get away 
 I tried to share my life with someone I could love 
 But games and money is all she ever thought of 
 How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost? 
 I'm tired of silly games, its time to make a change 
 Why is it I can't do whatever I want to? (oh) 
 Went in my personal life and I don't live for you (you) 
 So don't you try to tell me what is right for me (try it) 
 You be concerned about you, I can do what I want to 
 Xscape, (hoo-hoo) (oh, no) 
 Got to get away from a system loose in the world today 
 (I've got to get away) 
 Xscape, 
 The pressure that I face from relationships that go away 
 (Don't you know I need it?)

 (Get away) 
 Xscape,

 Xscape,

 (Hoo-hoo) 
 When I go, (oh, go) this problem world won't bother me no more 
 (This problem world won't bother me no more)
