Who's? (Looking For A Lover?) 
 Who's? (Looking For A Lover?) 
 Early this morning while I was yawning 
 I got a warning thought 
 Somebody near me who doesn't fear me 
 Knows things I ain't been taught 
 Somebody older (Somebody) somebody bolder 
 Wants to get hold to me, yeah 
 (Wants to get hold to me) 
 Somebody smart wants my young heart 
 I will a start, I will a start 
 Who's Looking For A Lover? 
 Who'll pick me out from all the crowd? 
 What thrills will I discover? 
 Why love is scared or do myself proud...? 
 Who's? (Looking For A Lover?) 
 Who's? (Looking For A Lover?) 
 Maybe some honey just wants my money 
 Hey, that's a funny tought 
 Someone appealing could set me reeling 
 And get my feelings caught 
 Somebody older (Somebody) somebody bolder (Somebody) 
 Wants to get hold to me, yeah 
 (Wants to get hold to me) 
 Somebody strong help me belong 
 Answer my song, answer my song 
 Who's Looking For A Lover? 
 Who wants to know what I can do? 
 Who's Looking For A Lover? 
 I'm looking everywhere for you 
 Somebody older (Somebody) somebody bolder (Somebody) 
 Wants to get hold to me, yeah 
 (Wants to get hold to me) 
 Somebody strong help me belong 
 Answer my song, answer my song 
 Who's Looking For A Lover? 
 Who wants to know what I can do? 
 Who's Looking For A Lover? 
 I'm looking everywhere for you 
 Somebody older (Somebody) somebody bolder (Somebody) 
 Wants to get hold to me, yeah 
 (Wants to get hold to me) 
 Somebody strong help me belong 
 Answer my song, answer my song
