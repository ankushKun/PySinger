Ready? 
 1, 2, 3, 4 
 This is it, here I stand 
 I'm the light of the world, I'll feel grand 
 Got this love, I can feel 
 And I know, yes for sure, it is real 
 And it feels as though I've seen your face a thousand times 
 And you said you really know me too yourself 
 And I know that you have got addicted with your eyes 
 But you say you're gonna leave it for yourself 
 Oh 
 I never heard a single word about you 
 Falling in love wasn't my plan 
 I never thought that I would be your lover 
 Come on baby just understand 
 This is it I can say 
 I'm the light of your world, run away 
 We can feel This is real 
 Every time I'm in love that I feel 
 And I feel as though I've known you since a thousand years 
 And you tell me that you've seen my face before 
 And you said to me that you don't want me hanging around 
 Many times wanna do it here before 
 Oh yeah 
 I never heard a single word about you 
 Falling in love wasn't my plan 
 I never thought that I would be your lover 
 Come on baby just understand 
 This is it, I can feel 
 I'm the light of the world, this is real 
 Feel my song, we can say 
 And I tell you can feel that way 
 And I feels as though I've known you for a thousand years 
 And you said you saw my face yourself 
 And you said want to go with you on a while 
 And I know that it's really for myself 
 Oh yeah 
 I never heard a single word about you 
 Falling in love wasn't my plan 
 I never thought that I would be your lover 
 Come on please dear understand 
 I never heard a single word about you 
 Falling in love wasn't my plan 
 I never thought that I would be your lover 
 Come on dear please understand
