Damn... 
 I don't do this for fun man 
 It's my job, dawg 
 All you see is the videos and the rings and the watch 
 And the bracelet, and chains 
 And you know, grills and more chains 
 Another chain on top of that 
 And another ring on another finger, and another grill 
 And then I switch grills and then I change chains 
 And that's all you see, but you know? 
 'Ey 
 I wake up early in the morning 
 Hit the snooze button for hours 
 Get up, hop into a two hundred thousand dollar shower 
 Brush my teeth when I'm out it 
 Remote start the Audi 
 Kiss my boy, kiss my girl, kiss my wife, and then I'm outtie 
 Damn 
 Grind time from a struggle to a hussle 
 "Aw man"s to "God damn"s 
 From a clam to a mussel 
 I ain't say you had it better 
 But damn, did I tussle 
 I ain't have much 
 But if you tried to take it, I'll bust ya 
 It feels like I done died 
 'Cause every time I drive my past life flash 
 Right in front of my eyes 
 'Cause I'm not one of them guys 
 That don't remember shit, 
 Can't even go home and drive alone in this whip 
 'Cause everybody want him gone 
 But you got me fucked up 
 If a nigga gon' be on YouTube saying' 
 I ain't from my bowin' homes [?] 
 So I'm gonna keep goin' strong 
 And let you niggas go out of season 
 As long as my kids is breathin' 
 I'm doing this for a lot of reason 
 I do it for my kids and they kids' kids 
 And when I'm dead they come to my grave 
 To tell me what they kids did, yeah 
 I'mma tell 'em my style and how long I has hated on about it 
 And how it took twenty minutes to make a song about it 
 Even though I was young I was actin' grown about it 
 Took some years, but eventually they left me 'lone about it 
 Old folks cheering' me on 'cause they know I got it 
 They see niggas get in the game and fold like origami 
 But the only foldin' I'm doin' is when I'm at shows poppin' 
 Got 'em fainting' like Michael Jackson, straight hos droppin' 
 Then I go home, safely homie, there's no robbin' 
 Gated community 
 You gotta know the code, partna 
 Walk up to the crib 
 Lamborghini look so proper 
 And six old-schools sittin' on 24" choppas 
 White folks in my neighborhood think I'm the Dalai Lama 
 'Specially when I come outside like roo sticky dima [?] 
 But everything good gotta turn bad 
 It's like the weekly drama, 
 You know, lil' small shit, 
 Like girls saying' they my baby mama 
 But this music has made me calmer 
 I now understand karma 
 These niggas is mad, 
 They wanna assassinate me 
 Like Barack Obama 
 But I graduated, School of Hard Knocks, summa cum laude 
 On the side of the stage 
 Like I am really 'bout to fuck this crowd up 
 That makes me prouder, makes me a man 
 If you ain't doin' what I'm' doin' 
 You automatically a fan 
 Damn, get on your knees please 
 And praise God that he sent you somebody 
 That can just tell you niggas these things
