I gave her money, I gave her time 
 I gave her everything inside one heart could find 
 I gave her passion, my very soul 
 I gave her promises and secrets so untold 
 And she promised me forever and a day we'd live as one 
 We made a vow we'd live a life anew 
 And she promised me in secret that she'd love me for all time 
 It's a promise so untrue 
 Tell me, what will I do? 
 And it doesn't seem to matter, and it doesn't seem right 
 'Cause the will has brought no fortune 
 Still I cry alone at night 
 Don't you judge of my composure, 'cause I'm lying to myself 
 And the reason why she left me 
 Did she find in someone else? 
 (Who is it?) It is a friend of mine 
 (Who is it?) Is it my brother? 
 (Who is it?) Somebody hurt my soul, now 
 (Who is it?) I can't take this stuff no more 
 I am the damned, I am the dead 
 I am the agony inside the dying head 
 This is injustice, woe unto thee 
 I pray this punishment would have mercy on me 
 And she promised me forever that we'd live our life as one 
 We made our vow to live love so true 
 It seems that she has left me for such reasons unexplained 
 I need to find the truth 
 But, see, what will I do? 
 And it doesn't seem to matter, and it doesn't seem right 
 'Cause the will has brought no fortune 
 Still I cry alone at night 
 Don't you judge of my composure, 'cause I'm bothered everyday 
 And she didn't leave a letter 
 She just upped and ran away 
 (Who is it?) It is a friend of mine 
 (Who is it?) Is it my brother? 
 (Who is it?) Somebody hurt my soul, now 
 (Who is it?) I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely 
 Hee, Hee 
 Hee, Hee 
 spoken: 
 Don't try to make me, 
 Don't try to make me crazy 
 I never wanted this 
 It just won't stop 
 Don't bother me 
 Don't bother me 
 (Who is it?) It is a friend of mine 
 (Who is it?) To me, I'm bothered 
 (Who is it?) Somebody hurt my soul, now 
 (Who is it?) (Oww!) I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely 
 And it doesn't seem to matter, (Hee, Hee) 
 And it doesn't seem right (Hee, Hee) 
 'Cause the will has brought no fortune 
 Still I cry alone at night 
 Don't you judge of my composure, 'cause I'm lying to myself 
 And the reason why she left me 
 Did she find in someone else? 
 And it doesn't seem to matter, (Don't bother me) 
 And it doesn't seem right (Da, Da, Da-rat) 
 'Cause the will has brought no fortune (Da-rat, Da-rat) 
 Still I cry alone at night (Me? Never, never, never) 
 Don't you judge of my composure, 'cause I'm bothered everyday 
 And she didn't leave a letter 
 She just upped and ran away (You can really see I'm lonely) 
 And it doesn't seem to matter, 
 And it doesn't seem right (Hee, Hee) 
 'Cause the will has brought no fortune 
 Still I cry alone at night (Da, Da, Da, Da) 
 Don't you judge of my composure, (Don't be) 
 'Cause I'm lying to myself (Don't be, don't be judgin') 
 And the reason why she left me (Don't you, don't you) 
 Did she find in someone else? (Keep begging 'cause I'm lonely) 
 And it doesn't seem to matter, (Don't bother me) 
 And it doesn't seem right 
 'Cause the will has brought no fortune (Da-rat, Da-rat) 
 Still I cry alone at night (Me? Never, never, never) 
 Don't you judge of my composure, (Don't be judgin') 
 'Cause I'm bothered everyday (Don't be) 
 (Don't be) And she didn't leave a letter 
 She just upped and ran away (Can't you really feel I'm lonely) 
 And it doesn't seem to matter, (Hee, Hee) 
 And it doesn't seem right (Hee, Hee) 
 'Cause the will has brought no fortune 
 Still I cry alone at night 
 Don't you judge of my composure, (She don't, she don't phone me) 
 'Cause I'm bothered everyday (She gone and did it) 
 And she didn't leave a letter (She don't, she don't matter) 
 She just upped and ran away (Is it my brother?) 
 And it doesn't seem to matter, (Don't bother me) 
 And it doesn't seem right (You just did it) 
 'Cause the will has brought no fortune (Da-da) 
 Still I cry alone at night (Da-da, Da-da, Da) 
 Don't you judge of my composure, (Hee) 
 (Hee) 'Cause I'm lying to myself 
 And the reason why she left me 
 Did she find in someone else? (I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)
