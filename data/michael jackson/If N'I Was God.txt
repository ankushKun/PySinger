If N' I Was God 
 Well just for spite 
 I wouldn't set the sun at night 
 Till everyone was treaded right 
 By everyone else they see 
 If N' I Was God 
 I'd fix it so, without explaining 
 Folks would know, they'd know 
 What's going on inside 
 Of everyone else like me 
 Nobody hurt nobody else 
 Oh I know, I wouldn't let it be 
 Nobody have a need to pray 
 Except, for thanking me 
 If N' I Was God 
 I'd make us wise 
 So everyone could realize 
 That everywhere beneath the sun 
 (Everyone needs everyone) 
 Everyone needs, everyone 
 And God... that in heaven what I would do 
 If N' I... were... you... uh uh... 
 Ah yeah 
 If N' I Was God 
 I'd make us wise 
 Everybody touch 
 Everybody's hand, ah yeah 
 Reach out and touch somebody's hand 
 You got to, you got to love everybody 
 You got to, you got to love everybody, yeah 
 You got to, you got to love everybody 
 You got to, you got to love everybody 
 You got to, you got to, you got to love everybody wow 
 You got to love everybody 
 You got to, you got to everybody 
 C'mon everybody 
 C'mon, c'mon everybody, yeah
