I was alone in the dark when I met ya 
 Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh 
 You took my hand and you told me you loved me 
 Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh 
 I was alone, there was no love in my life 
 (I was alone, there was no love in my life) 
 I was afraid of life and you came in time 
 (I was afraid of life and you came in time) 
 You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight 
 (You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight) 
 Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh 
 I like the way how you're holdin' me 
 It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me 
 I like the way how you're lovin' me 
 It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me 
 I like the way how you're touchin' me 
 It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me 
 I like the way how you're kissin' me 
 It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me 
 You'll seeeee... 
 ...It won't be long till we make vows, I bet ya 
 Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh 
 I thank the Heavens above that I met ya 
 Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh 
 I was alone, there was no love in my life 
 (I was alone, there was no love in my life) 
 I was afraid of life and you came in time 
 (I was afraid of life and you came in time) 
 You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight 
 (You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight) 
 Uuuuuuuuuuh 
 Chorus (diff): 
 I like the way how you're lovin' me 
 It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me 
 I like the way how you're holdin' me 
 It doesn't matter how you re lovin' me 
 I like the way how you're touchin' me 
 It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me 
 I like the way how you're kissin' me 
 It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me 
 The world's a better place 'cause you came in time, 
 You took away the rain and brought the sunshine, 
 I was afraid 'cause I was hurt the last time, 
 Uuuuuuuuuuh Ah. 
 I like the way how you're holdin' me, 
 It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me, 
 I like the way how you're lovin' me, 
 It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me, 
 I like the way how you're touchin' me, 
 It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me, 
 I like the way how you're kissin' me, 
 It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me, 
 You seeeee. 
 Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh (x12)
