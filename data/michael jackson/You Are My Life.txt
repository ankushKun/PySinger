Once all alone 
 I was lost in a world of strangers 
 No one to trust 
 On my own, I was lonely 
 You suddenly appeared 
 It was cloudy before but now it's all clear 
 You took away the fear 
 You brought me back to light 
 You are the sun (You are the sun) 
 You make me shine (You make me shine) 
 Or more like the stars (Stars) 
 That (that) twinkle at night (twinkle at night) 
 You are the moon (You are the moon) 
 That glows in my heart (That glows in my heart) 
 You're my daytime my night time 
 My world 
 You are my life... You are my life... 
 Now I wake up everyday 
 With this smile upon my face 
 No more tears, no more pain 
 Cause you love me 
 You help me understand 
 That love is the answer to all that I am 
 And I'm a better man 
 Since you taught me by sharing your life 
 You are the sun (You are the sun) 
 You make me shine (You make me shine) 
 Or more like the stars (Stars) 
 That (that) twinkle at night (twinkle at night) 
 You are the moon (You are the moon) 
 That glows in my heart (That glows in my heart) 
 You're my daytime my night time 
 My world 
 You are the sun (You are the sun) 
 You make me shine (You make me shine) 
 Or more like the stars (Stars) 
 That (that) twinkle at night (twinkle at night) 
 You are the moon (You are the moon) 
 That glows in my heart (That glows in my heart) 
 You're my daytime my night time 
 My world 
 You gave me strength 
 When I wasn't strong (I wasn't strong...) 
 You gave me hope when all hope is lost 
 You opened my eyes when I couldn't see (I couldn't see...) 
 Love was always here waiting for me, me~ 
 You are the sun (You are the sun) 
 You make me shine (You make me shine) 
 Or more like the stars (Stars) 
 That (that) twinkle at night (twinkle at night) 
 You are the moon (You are the moon) 
 That glows in my heart (That glows in my heart) 
 You're my daytime my night time 
 My world 
 You are the sun (You are the sun) 
 You make me shine (You make me shine) 
 Or more like the stars (More like the stars) 
 That (that) twinkle (the night time) at night (twinkle at night) (I love you) 
 You are the moon (All right, now) 
 (You are the sun) That glows in my heart 
 You're my daytime my night time 
 My world 
 You are the sun (You are the sun) 
 You make me shine (You make me shine) 
 Or more like the stars (More like the stars) 
 That (that) twinkle (the night time) at night (twinkle at night) (I love you) 
 You are the moon (You are the moon) 
 That glows in my heart (That glows in my heart) 
 You're my daytime my night time 
 My world 
 You are my life
