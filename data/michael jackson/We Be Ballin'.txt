Nothing you can say 
 Nothing you can do 
 We'll be ballin you 
 We'll be ballin you 
 No one can it... 
 And see what you're goin' through 
 We'll be ballin you 
 We'll be ballin you 
 Step back when I slap on the mike like that 
 Came from the ghetto and now it's a better man 
 I got an... trick using my white head 
 ... 
 I came up the disco when I go near 
 My game it kills Am I for real 
 I'm the Michael Jack the rap I close the deal 
 Getting' grey in a... I'm gonna steal your wheel 
 Gonna... me a MILF... for my boys to kill 
 I love this stuff... 
 It ain't easy pippin' it pippin' it and pay the bill 
 I'm ballin you and I'm... a century 
 I'm ballin too...
