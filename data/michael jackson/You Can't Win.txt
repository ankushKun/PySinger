You can't win, you can't break even 
 And you can't get out of the game 
 People keep sayin' things are gonna change 
 But they look just like they're stayin' the same 
 You get in way over your head 
 And you've only got yourself to blame 
 You can't win chil' 
 (You can't win chil') 
 You ain't break even 
 And you can't get out of the game 
 You can't win, the world keeps movin' 
 And you're standin' far behind 
 People keep sayin', things'll get better 
 (Just to ease your state of mind) 
 (So you lean back, and you smoke that smoke) 
 (And you drink your glass of wine) 
 Sayin' you can't win, chil', you can't break even 
 And you can't get out of the game 
 You can't win, you can't win no way 
 If your story stays the same, no, no 
 (You ain't winnin') 
 (But it's nice to see you) 
 (I'm awfully glad you came) 
 (Better cool it 'cause it ain't about losin') 
 And the world has got no shame 
 You can't win, chil' 
 You can't break even 
 You can't get out of the game 
 You can't win, you can't break even 
 Ain't the way it's supposed to be, no, no 
 (You'll be spendin') 
 (Your little bit of money) 
 While someone else rides for free, ooh 
 (Learn your lesson) 
 (Refuel your mind) 
 (Before someone blows out your flame) 
 You can't win, chil' (no, you can't win) 
 You can't win chil' (no, you can't win) 
 You can't win chil' (no, you can't win) 
 You can't win chil' (no, you can't win) 
 You can't win, chil', you can't break even 
 And you can't get out of the game 
 You can't get out of the game 
 You can't get out PHEW! of the game, no, no
