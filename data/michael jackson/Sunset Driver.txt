All alone 
 She's in the ego zone 
 The word is out that you're doin' wrong 
 On the move 
 Got fire in your shoes 
 By word of mouth you are on the news 
 You're livin' in sunset times (Livin' in sunset times) 
 Feelin' bad 
 You're livin' much too fast 
 The truth, the truth that you're on the pass 
 In the raw 
 They don't know what you saw 
 By word of mouth you're breakin' every law 
 Sunset driver 
 Midnight rider 
 Friday's brighter 
 Morning rider 
 You're a Saturday-nighter, aow! 
 On the go 
 Got fever in your soul 
 You better not shout where you gonna go 
 Livin' hot 
 Doin' what you should not 
 The break's on me, then what do you got 
 You're livin' on sunset times (Livin' on sunset times) 
 Want that dime 
 Shoot the breeze 
 You feel that she's a tease 
 Your night is free, what you wanna be 
 Who's to trust 
 When livin' dangerous 
 Tonight's your night, but this is what you loose 
 Sunset driver 
 Midnight rider 
 Friday's brighter 
 Gettin' higher 
 You're a Saturday-nighter, aow! 
 You are there when the night's in town 
 Standin' there with the top of the round 
 They don't care about the things you wished you saw 
 You're like the cinema 
 You think that nothin's wrong 
 Doin' town 
 You do it every time 
 The word's got out that you're on the line 
 On the move 
 Got fever in your shoes 
 The night's on you, what are you gonna do? 
 Sunset driver 
 Midnight rider 
 Friday's brighter 
 Just to reach that driver 
 The Saturday-nighter, aow!
