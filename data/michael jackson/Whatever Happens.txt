He gives another smile, tries to understand her side 
 To show that he cares, she can't stay in the room 
 She's consumed with everything that's been goin' on 
 She says 
 Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand 
 Everything will be alright, he assures her 
 But she doesn't hear a word that he says 
 Preoccupied, she's afraid 
 Afraid what they've been doin's not right 
 He doesn't know what to say, so he prays 
 Whatever, whatever, whatever 
 Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand 
 Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand 
 Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand 
 Don't let go of my hand 
 Don't let go of my hand 
 He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy 
 Forgetting all the dreams that he had 
 He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world 
 It doesn't have to be that bad 
 She tried to explain, "It's you that makes me happy," 
 Whatever, whatever, whatever 
 Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand 
 Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand 
 Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand 
 Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand 
 Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand 
 Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand 
 Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand 
 Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
